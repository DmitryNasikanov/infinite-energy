# Project Helios Budget

> **TL;DR**
>
> - **Total budget:** $190–470 billion (with inflation $240–590 billion over 10 years)
> - **Import from Earth:** ~2,550 t electronics (~100 launches)

---

## Currency and Inflation

**All amounts are in 2026 US dollars** (USD 2026).

Historical projects are adjusted for inflation. For a 10-year project we account for:

- Average US inflation (2015-2026): ~2.5%/year
- Over 10 years: (1.023)^10 = 1.255 ≈ **+25%**
- This is a conservative estimate; actual inflation may be higher

| Scenario | 2026 Nominal | With 10-year inflation |
|----------|--------------|----------------------|
| Optimistic | ~$190 billion | **~$240 billion** |
| Baseline | ~$340 billion | **~$425 billion** |
| Conservative | ~$470 billion | **~$590 billion** |

| VR simulators and training | 0.5-1 billion | |
| Scientific research | 1-2 billion | Materials science, thermodynamics |
| **Total R&D** | **3-5 billion** | |

### 2. AI Development for Robots

**Why easier than Waymo/Tesla:**
- No pedestrians, cyclists, unpredictable people
- No traffic rules, signs, intersections — only factory tasks
- Fixed operations (mining, assembly) vs infinite driving scenarios
- Can fail and retry — not real-time safety-critical

**Characteristics:**
- Autonomy due to 5-20 min communication delay
- Extreme conditions require reliable hardware

## Analysis: Which Items Are Underestimated?

Comparison with real projects shows some estimates may be optimistic.

### 1. AI Development (was: $15-20 billion → revised: $25-40 billion)

**References:**

| Company | Spent | Result | Source |
|---------|-------|--------|--------|
| OpenAI | $20+ billion | GPT-4, no AGI | [DCD](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/) |
| Waymo | $11 billion over 15 years | No full autonomy | [VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/) |
| Tesla FSD | $15 billion over 8 years | Level 2 autopilot | [CleanTechnica](https://cleantechnica.com/) |
| DeepMind | $50+ billion | Research | [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_DeepMind) |

**Problem:** Helios requires fully autonomous robots in conditions where Waymo/Tesla would fail:
- Vacuum, radiation, +430°C/-180°C
- 5-20 minute communication delay (no GPS, no real-time)
- Unpredictable regolith and conditions

**Adjustment for baseline scenario:** $18 → $30 billion (+$12 billion)

### 2. Rocket Program (was: $8-10 billion → revised: $10-14 billion)

**References:**

| Program | Cost | Result |
|---------|------|--------|
| SLS | $35 billion | 1 rocket (expendable) |
| Starship | $5-10 billion | Development (no serial production) |
| Long March 9 (planned) | $10-15 billion | Chinese super-heavy |

**Thanks to 99.998% localization:** Only ~100 rockets needed (not ~54,000). $50M/rocket × 100 = $5 billion — realistic.

**If a new rocket is needed (Russia+China):** +$5-8 billion for contribution to joint launcher development.

**Adjustment for baseline scenario:** $55 → $75 billion (+$20 billion)

### 3. Factory Production (was: $46-49 billion → revised: $60-80 billion)

**References:**

| Factory | Cost |
|---------|------|
| Tesla Gigafactory Shanghai | ~$2 billion |
| Tesla Gigafactory Nevada | ~$5 billion |
| Semiconductor fab (Taiwan) | $12-20 billion |

**Counterargument:** Helios factories are simple metallurgy, not semiconductors. At 1650-unit series, price drops.

**However:** These are **autonomous space factories on Mercury**. $30M/unit at 1650 series — optimistic.

**Adjustment:** $30M → $50M/factory = $82.5 billion (×1.7)

### 4. Launches ($55 billion = $2,500/kg) ✓

This estimate is realistic assuming operational [100+ t heavy rockets](roadmap.qmd#next-generation-super-heavy-launchers):
- SpaceX Falcon 9: $2,700-5,000/kg (today)
- Heavy rockets (target): $1,000-1,500/kg
- Long March: $3,000/kg

**With developed infrastructure and launcher mix — $2,500/kg is achievable.**

### Adjustment Summary

| Item | Was (baseline) | Became | Δ |
|------|----------------|--------|---|
| AI Development | 18 | 30 | +12 |
| Rocket program | 9 | 12 | +3 |
| Production | 68 | 100 | +32 |
| **Total adjustment** | | | **+47** |

This increases the baseline scenario from ~$227 to ~$274 billion, and with ×1.5 reserve — to ~$430 billion.

### Conservative Scenario (~$470 billion, or ~$590 billion with inflation)

**Conditions:**
- Heavy rockets delayed until 2032

## Why Not a Trillion?

### American projects are inflated due to:

1. **Cost-plus contracts** — contractor benefits from spending more
2. **Bureaucracy** — approvals, reviews, reports
3. **Contractor monopoly** — Boeing, Lockheed without competition
4. **Legal costs** — lawsuits, patents, insurance

### Examples of budget inflation:

| Project | Initial budget | Final | Growth |
|---------|----------------|-------|--------|
| James Webb | $1 billion | $10 billion | ×10 |
| SLS | $9 billion | $23+ billion | ×2.5 |
| F-35 | $233 billion | $400+ billion | ×1.7 |

### Why Helios is different:

1. **International competition** — China, Russia, India are cheaper
2. **Mass production** — 1650 factories, 60,000 robots, economies of scale
3. **Fixed-price contracts** — not cost-plus
4. **Common goal** — fewer political games

### Comparison with Real Projects

## Known Limitations

> **Attention:** This section describes problems requiring solutions.

### High-Priority Issues

#### 1. Testing and Debugging Underestimated

| Stage | Current estimate | Realistic estimate | Rationale |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Factory prototypes | 3–5 iterations | **5–10 iterations** | 3-5 ground (Gansu) + 2-5 lunar |
| Robot prototypes | $2 billion | **$5–10 billion** | Hundreds of versions, thousands of units |
| Lunar Test Site | 2 years | **1.5–2.5 years** | 3-5 iterations × 3-5 months + deployment |

**Reason:** The ground test site (Gansu) allows completing major iterations before going to the Moon (TRL 4→6). The Moon validates in the real environment (TRL 6→7-8). Lunar iteration cycle with dedicated launches: ~2-4 months (3-day flight; main time is analysis and fix manufacturing).

**Detailed methodology:** [Risks → Testing Estimation Methodology](../reference/risks.qmd#testing-estimation-methodology)

#### 2. Ground Reception Infrastructure

| Parameter | Current estimate | Realistic estimate |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Station construction | $3–5 billion | **$10–20 billion** |
| Approvals (land, frequencies) | Not counted | **$2–5 billion** |
| Environmental reviews | Not counted | **$0.5–2 billion** |

**Reason:** Placing hundreds of receiving stations requires international agreements, land rights, frequency regulation.

### Require Research

#### 3. Mission Insurance

- $2–4 billion — optimistic for 10,000 tons of cargo
- At real risk rates, may be 5–10% of cargo value
- **Realistic:** $5–10 billion for insurance

#### 4. Political Risks

- Sanctions between countries → cooperation breakdown
- Government changes → priority shifts
- Competition instead of cooperation → cost duplication

**Cannot be estimated, but potentially +50–100% to budget.**
