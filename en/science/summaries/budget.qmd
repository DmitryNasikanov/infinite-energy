## Currency and Inflation

**All amounts are in 2026 US dollars** (USD 2026).

Historical projects are adjusted for inflation. For a 10-year project we account for:

- Average US inflation (2015-2026): ~2.5%/year
- Over 10 years: (1.023)^10 = 1.255 ≈ **+25%**
- This is a conservative estimate; actual inflation may be higher

| Scenario | 2026 Nominal | With 10-year inflation |
|----------|--------------|----------------------|
| Optimistic | ~$320 billion | **~$400 billion** |
| Baseline | ~$500 billion | **~$625 billion** |
| Conservative | ~$700 billion | **~$875 billion** |

| Resources | Delivery from Moon | **In-situ** |

#### LSP Characteristics

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Stations | 20-40 on lunar limbs |
| Total mass | ~178,000 t (per data.json HUB-001) |
| Materials | Al 60%, Cu 28%, Si 9%, Fe 0.3% — local |
| Electronics from Earth | ~100-200 t (1-2 launches) |

#### LSP Cost

## Analysis: Which Items Are Underestimated?

Comparison with real projects shows some estimates may be optimistic.

### 1. AI Development (was: $15-20 billion → revised: $25-40 billion)

**References:**

| Company | Spent | Result | Source |
|---------|-------|--------|--------|
| OpenAI | $20+ billion | GPT-4, no AGI | [DCD](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/) |
| Waymo | $11 billion over 15 years | No full autonomy | [VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/) |
| Tesla FSD | $15 billion over 8 years | Level 2 autopilot | [CleanTechnica](https://cleantechnica.com/) |
| DeepMind | $50+ billion | Research | [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_DeepMind) |

**Problem:** Helios requires fully autonomous robots in conditions where Waymo/Tesla would fail:
- Vacuum, radiation, +430°C/-180°C
- 5-20 minute communication delay (no GPS, no real-time)
- Unpredictable regolith and conditions

**Adjustment for baseline scenario:** $18 → $30 billion (+$12 billion)

### 2. Rocket Program (was: $53-60 billion → revised: $70-100 billion)

**References:**

| Program | Cost | Result |
|---------|------|--------|
| SLS | $35 billion | 1 rocket (expendable) |
| Starship | $5-10 billion | Development (no serial production) |
| Long March 9 (planned) | $10-15 billion | Chinese super-heavy |

**If [heavy rockets](roadmap.qmd#next-generation-super-heavy-launchers) are available:** $50M/rocket × 900 = $45 billion — realistic.

**If a new rocket is needed (Russia+China):** +$20-30 billion for developing own launcher.

**Adjustment for baseline scenario:** $55 → $75 billion (+$20 billion)

### 3. Factory Production (was: $46-49 billion → revised: $60-80 billion)

**References:**

| Factory | Cost |
|---------|------|
| Tesla Gigafactory Shanghai | ~$2 billion |
| Tesla Gigafactory Nevada | ~$5 billion |
| Semiconductor fab (Taiwan) | $12-20 billion |

**Counterargument:** Helios factories are simple metallurgy, not semiconductors. At 1650-unit series, price drops.

**However:** These are **autonomous space factories on Mercury**. $30M/unit at 1650 series — optimistic.

**Adjustment:** $30M → $50M/factory = $82.5 billion (×1.7)

### 4. Launches ($55 billion = $2,500/kg) ✓

This estimate is realistic assuming operational [100+ t heavy rockets](roadmap.qmd#next-generation-super-heavy-launchers):
- SpaceX Falcon 9: $2,700-5,000/kg (today)
- Heavy rockets (target): $1,000-1,500/kg
- Long March: $3,000/kg

**With developed infrastructure and launcher mix — $2,500/kg is achievable.**

### Adjustment Summary

| Item | Was (baseline) | Became | Δ |
|------|----------------|--------|---|
| AI Development | 18 | 30 | +12 |
| Rocket program | 55 | 75 | +20 |
| Production | 68 | 100 | +32 |
| **Total adjustment** | | | **+64** |

This increases the baseline scenario from ~$293 to ~$357 billion, and with ×1.5 reserve — to ~$535 billion.

## Three Scenarios (revised)

### Optimistic Scenario (~$350 billion)

**Conditions:**
- Heavy rockets operational by 2028, price $1,000/kg
- China and Russia take on 50% of production
- AI reaches required level in 4-5 years (not 6-7)
- Series effect reduces prices by 30%

| Category | Estimate ($ billion) |
|----------|---------------------|
| R&D (excluding AI) | 3 |
| **AI Development** | 12 |
| **Earth Test Site** | 6 |

| Additional | 20 |
| Reserve (+20%) | 39 |
| **TOTAL** | **~233 billion** |
| **With ×1.5 margin** | **~350 billion** |

### Baseline Scenario (~$570 billion, or ~$710 billion with inflation)

**Conditions:**
- Launcher mix (Starship + Long March + Soyuz)
- International cooperation works
- AI requires 6-7 years of development
- Moderate delays and overruns
- Underestimated item adjustments included

| Category | Estimate ($ billion) |
|----------|---------------------|

| **TOTAL (USD 2026)** | **~454 billion** |
| **With ×1.25 margin** | **~$570 billion** |
| **With +25% inflation** | **~$710 billion** |

### Conservative Scenario (~$750 billion, or ~$930 billion with inflation)

**Conditions:**
- Heavy rockets delayed until 2032
- AI requires 8-10 years and additional iterations
- Political complications increase costs
- Technical problems require rework
- Development of own super-heavy launcher needed

| Category | Estimate ($ billion) |
|----------|---------------------|
| R&D (excluding AI) | 6 |
| **AI Development** | 50 |
| **Earth Test Site** | 14 |
| Lunar Test Site | 20 |
| Production | 130 |

## Why Not a Trillion?

### American projects are inflated due to:

1. **Cost-plus contracts** — contractor benefits from spending more
2. **Bureaucracy** — approvals, reviews, reports
3. **Contractor monopoly** — Boeing, Lockheed without competition
4. **Legal costs** — lawsuits, patents, insurance

### Examples of budget inflation:

| Project | Initial budget | Final | Growth |
|---------|----------------|-------|--------|
| James Webb | $1 billion | $10 billion | ×10 |
| SLS | $9 billion | $23+ billion | ×2.5 |
| F-35 | $233 billion | $400+ billion | ×1.7 |

### Why Helios is different:

1. **International competition** — China, Russia, India are cheaper
2. **Mass production** — 1650 factories, 60,000 robots, economies of scale
3. **Fixed-price contracts** — not cost-plus
4. **Common goal** — fewer political games

## Final Estimate

### Without Inflation (USD 2026)

| Scenario | Amount | Comment |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Optimistic | ~$320 billion | Heavy rockets work, AI in 5 years |
| **Baseline** | **~$510 billion** | Realistic mix, AI in 6-7 years |
| Conservative | ~$750 billion | Delays, AI in 8-10 years |

### With Inflation (+25% over 10 years)

| Scenario | 2026 Nominal | With inflation | Comment |
|----------|--------------|----------------|---------|
| Optimistic | ~$320 billion | **~$400 billion** | Everything goes as planned |
| **Baseline** | **~$510 billion** | **~$640 billion** | Moderate delays |
| Conservative | ~$750 billion | **~$930 billion** | Serious problems |

**For comparison:**
- Apollo: ~$280 billion (USD 2026) — 12 people on Moon
- Helios (baseline): ~$640 billion — **energy for the entire planet forever**
- This is ~2× Apollo for a result millions of times greater

## Year-by-Year Distribution (baseline scenario)

| Year | Phase | Main expenses | Amount (billion) |
|------|-------|---------------|------------------|
| 1-2 | R&D, AI start | AI team, design | 35-45 |
| 3-4 | Earth Test Site, AI | Construction in China, model training | 65-80 |
| 5-6 | Lunar Test Site, production | Lunar missions, mass production | 90-110 |
| 7-8 | Mercury: deployment | First expeditions, Mass Drivers | 110-130 |
| 9-10 | Mercury: scaling | Expansion, energy reception | 100-120 |
| **Total (USD 2026)** | | | **410-510** |
| **With inflation** | | | **~510-640** |

## Known Limitations

> **Attention:** This section describes problems requiring solutions.

### Critical Issues

#### 1. AI Budget Underestimated

| Parameter | In calculations | Realistic estimate |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| AI Development | $15–30 billion | **$50–100 billion** |
| Development time | 5–7 years | **8–12 years** |

**Reasons:**
- Waymo spent $11 billion over 15 years and hasn't achieved full autonomy
- Tesla FSD: $15+ billion over 8 years — level 2 (not full autonomy)
- Mercury conditions are harder: vacuum, radiation, no GPS, 670 sec delay

**Reference:** OpenAI spent $20+ billion and hasn't achieved AGI. Autonomous robots in extreme conditions are harder than language models.

#### 2. Launch Costs Depend on Launcher Development Pace

By 2030, next-generation super-heavy launchers are expected:

| Launcher | Country | Payload | Status (2025) |
|----------|---------|---------|---------------|
| Starship | USA | 150–200 t | Testing |
| Long March 9 | China | 150 t | Development |
| Yenisei | Russia | 100 t | Development |
| New Glenn | USA | 45 t | Testing |
| SHLV | India | ~100 t | Concept |
| Ariane Next | EU | ~100 t | Concept |

| Scenario | Launch cost | Budget impact |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| Launchers reach $1,000–1,500/kg by 2030 | Baseline scenario | — |
| Delay to $2,500–3,500/kg | Launchers 2–3 years late | **+$30–50 billion** |

**Risk:** Baseline scenario assumes $2,500/kg. Delays in super-heavy launcher development increase budget by 10–15%.

### High-Priority Issues

#### 3. Testing and Debugging Underestimated

| Stage | Current estimate | Realistic estimate |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Factory prototypes | 3–5 iterations | **10–20 iterations** |
| Robot prototypes | $2 billion | **$5–10 billion** |
| Lunar Test Site | 2 years | **3–5 years** |

**Reason:** Each failure in space costs months of waiting and millions in restart.

#### 4. Ground Reception Infrastructure

| Parameter | Current estimate | Realistic estimate |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Station construction | $3–5 billion | **$10–20 billion** |
| Approvals (land, frequencies) | Not counted | **$2–5 billion** |
| Environmental reviews | Not counted | **$0.5–2 billion** |

**Reason:** Placing hundreds of receiving stations requires international agreements, land rights, frequency regulation.

### Require Research

#### 5. Mission Insurance

- $2–4 billion — optimistic for 22,000 tons of cargo
- At real risk rates, may be 5–10% of cargo value
- **Realistic:** $10–20 billion for insurance

#### 6. Political Risks

- Sanctions between countries → cooperation breakdown
- Government changes → priority shifts
- Competition instead of cooperation → cost duplication

**Cannot be estimated, but potentially +50–100% to budget.**

### Final Adjustment

| Scenario | Current estimate | With limitations |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Optimistic | $320 billion | **$400–450 billion** |
| Baseline | $500 billion | **$700–800 billion** |
| Conservative | $700 billion | **$1,000–1,200 billion** |

**Conclusion:** Realistic budget is closer to $700–800 billion (not $500 billion), and conservative may reach a trillion.
