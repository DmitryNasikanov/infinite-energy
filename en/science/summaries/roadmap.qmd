## Track 1: Preparation Phases

| Phase | Years | Budget ($B) | Peak Staff | Launches |
|-------|-------|-------------|------------|----------|
| **1: R&D** | 1-6+ | 15-30 | 30-50K | - |
| **2: Earth Proving Ground** | 2-4 | 12-20 | 15-25K | - |

| **TOTAL** | **1-10** | **250-400** | **~50K peak** | **~920** |

*Budget with 2x contingency. Personnel calculation: $200K/person/year.*

---

### Phase 1: R&D and Development (years 1-6+)

**Parallel phase:** R&D starts in year 1 and continues throughout the preparation period (until year 6+). Technology development runs in parallel with testing on Earth (years 2-4) and Moon (years 4-6). Design, simulations, AI development do not stop until full Mercury readiness is achieved.

**Budget: $15-30B | Peak: 30-50K people**

#### Years 1-2: Intensive Design (peak load)

| Direction | Budget ($B) | People |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Swarm control software | 6-10 | 12-20K |
| Autonomy neural networks | 4-8 | 8-15K |
| VR simulators | 2-4 | 4-8K |
| Scientific research | 2-4 | 3-6K |

**For comparison:** SpaceX ~13K, Waymo ~2.5K, NVIDIA ~30K employees.

#### Years 3-6: Refinements and Validation (parallel with proving grounds)

**Focus evolution:**

| Period | Work Focus | Personnel |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Years 3-4** | Refinements based on Earth proving ground results | 20-30K |
| **Years 5-6** | Refinements based on Moon proving ground results | 10-20K |

**Main directions in years 3-6:**
- **Algorithm optimization** based on real proving ground data
- **Fixing identified problems** in factory and robot prototypes
- **Autonomy AI refinement** for real conditions (communication delays, unforeseen situations)
- **VR simulator adaptation** for space conditions (temperature, radiation, dust)
- **Technical documentation preparation** for Mercury

**Staff reduction:** As main design completes (years 1-2), the team gradually shrinks. Only engineers working on refinements and validation based on proving ground data remain.

#### Ground Zero Factory Design

::: {.callout-note}
## Goal and Calculation Status

The goal of this documentation is to confirm the **fundamental feasibility** of the project and provide preliminary budget and timeline estimates. Calculations confirm: all necessary technologies exist ([MRE electrolysis](../reference/technology-readiness.qmd#mre-molten-regolith-electrolysis), [WAAM](../reference/technology-readiness.qmd#waam-wire-arc-additive-manufacturing), solar concentration, [electromagnetic launch](../reference/technology-readiness.qmd#electromagnetic-launch-mass-driver)), materials on Mercury are present in sufficient quantities (Al, Fe, Si, Ti, S), delivery logistics are realistic at current launch cost trends.

All provided numbers (areas, productivities, material flows) are **preliminary order-of-magnitude estimates**. Transitioning to implementation requires work by a professional engineering team to refine parameters, detailed design, and validation of adopted decisions.
:::

The project's key unit is the **replicator factory (F-R)**, fully self-sufficient for building new factories ([lights-out factories TRL 9](../reference/technology-readiness.qmd#lights-out-factories)). The second type - **mirror factory (F-M)** - specializes in mirror production.

**Test result:**
- Proof of concept for full system
- Public demonstration (political support)
- Validation before Mercury

**Lunar proving ground advantages:**
- Errors are cheap - lost a lunar mission, not Mercurian
- Fast iterations - 3 days to Moon
- Public success - energy to Earth already at this stage

**Phase result:** Validated system (factory + MD + LSP + Swarm), ready for Mercury.

### Track 2: Rocket Program (parallel with Phases 1-3, years 1-6)

| Year | Tasks |
|------|-------|
| 1-2 | Carrier selection, manufacturer contracts |
| 2-4 | Spaceport modernization (Baikonur, Vostochny, partners) |
| 3-5 | Carrier production ramp-up |
| 4-6 | Test launches, Mercury trajectory refinement |

**Note:** The rocket industry - organic development. These capacities would develop anyway: commercial launches, satellite constellations, lunar programs. Project Helios only accelerates and directs the existing trend. Therefore, these costs are conditionally included in the project budget - additional targeted investments may be needed to accelerate the pace, but basic industry development would happen without the project.

**Result:** Readiness for 900 launches in 4 years.

---

## Phase 4: Mercury (years 6-10)

*After successful Moon validation.*

---

## Mercury Strategy: Test + Reinforcement

**Principle:** First we verify, then we scale.

| Stage | Cargo | Goal | Risk |
|-------|-------|------|------|
| Expedition 1 | 75 t | Test: 1 factory + 1 MD | If failure - lost 75 t |
| Expedition 2 | 150 t | Reinforcement: +3 factories | Only after E1 success |

**Advantages:**
- Risk reduction: not putting all eggs in one basket
- Acceleration: 4 factories instead of 1 = 4x faster growth
- Technology verification: first factory validates the concept

---

## Carrier Options

The project is not tied to a specific rocket. Delivery options:

### Current and Near-term Carriers (2026-2030)

| Carrier | Country | To LEO | To Mercury* | Status |
|---------|---------|-------:|------------:|--------|
| **Falcon Heavy** | USA | 64 t | ~20 t | Flying |

- Yenisei/Don: 600B rubles funding, flight tests from 2033

### E1 Delivery Scenarios (75 t)

| Scenario | Carriers | Flights | Note |
|----------|----------|---------|------|
| Optimal | Starship Block 2/3 | 1-2 | Minimum launches (2027+) |
| Nearest | Falcon Heavy + New Glenn | 4-5 | Available 2025 |
| International | Mixed fleet | 3-4 | Distributed risk |

**Conclusion:** By project start (2030s) next-generation heavy carriers will be operational. Average payload ~40-50 t to Mercury.

| Component | Mass | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Ground Zero Factory (modules) | 35 t | Gen-2 robot production |
| Gen-1 robots | 15 t | Factory assembly (56 pcs) |
| Starter concentrators | 1 t | 30 MW for first days |
| MD components | 20 t | Accelerated first Mass Driver assembly |
| Consumables | 4 t | Vitamins for one year |

**Key milestones:**

- Month 1: E2 launches (not waiting for full confirmation)
- Transit: ~3-4 months (direct trajectory)
- **Month 4-5: E2 arrives**

**Cargo: 150 tons** (see carrier options)

| Component | Mass | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| 3 factories (modules) | 105 t | Production scaling |
| Gen-1 robots | 30 t | Assembly acceleration (112 pcs) |
| MD components | 10 t | Spare parts for MD #2-4 |
| Consumables | 5 t | Vitamins for 2 years |

**Result:**
- Month 5: 4 factories operational
- Production: 60 robots/month (instead of 15)
- 4x faster growth
- First MD ready by month 6 (no delays)

---

## Regular Supplies from Earth

The base cannot be 100% autonomous. "Vitamins" are needed:

| Category | What exactly | Why not on-site |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| Electronics | Control units, sensors | No microchip production |
| Rare earths | Nd, Sm for magnets | Not on Mercury |
| Copper | Continuous casting crystallizers | Deficit on Mercury |
| Tungsten | Dies, cutters | Critical for processing |
| Iridium | MRE anodes | Ultra-rare |
| Gases | Argon, nitrogen | No atmosphere |

### Vitamin Requirements

```
Per factory/year:
- Electronics: ~10 kg (for ~180 robots)
- Dies/cutters: ~3 kg
- MRE anodes: ~4 kg
- Gases: ~10 kg
- Other: ~3 kg
TOTAL: ~30 kg/factory/year
```

### Supply Schedule

| Year | Factories | Vitamins | Add. factories* | Total cargo | Flights** |
|------|-----------|----------|-----------------|-------------|-----------|
| 1 | 25 | 1 t | +10 | ~400 t | 8-20 |
| 2 | 120 | 4 t | +30 | ~1,100 t | 22-55 |
| 3 | 500 | 15 t | +100 | ~3,600 t | 72-180 |
| 4 | 1,000 | 30 t | +200 | ~5,500 t | 110-275 |
| **Total** | | | | **~22,000 t*** | **~550** |

*Including first expeditions (225 t) and +30% reserve.
**Flights: minimum (Starship ~50 t) - maximum (Falcon Heavy ~20 t).

*Additional factories accelerate growth - each factory = +15 robots/month.

### Supply Economics

```
Delivery cost (Starship): ~$100/kg -> $100M for 1000 t
Delivery cost (current): ~$10,000/kg -> $10B for 1000 t

With Starship: year 3 supplies = ~$360M
This is cheap for a planetary-scale project.
```

**Conclusion:** Earth supplies are not a problem. This is <1% of mass produced on Mercury.

## Days 1-7: Starter Energy Deployment

### What We Do
1. Robots deploy starter concentrators (1 ton = 20,000 m^2^)
2. Install at "Peak of Eternal Light"
3. Connect to power system

### Result
```
Area: 20,000 m^2^
Solar flux: 10 kW/m^2^
PV efficiency (GaAs): 30%

Power = 20,000 x 10 x 0.3 = 60 MW
```

**60 MW - enough for 10 factories** (5 MW each, with margin)

---

## First Factory Assembly (Bootstrap)

### What We Do
- 56 Gen-1 robots (Li-S batteries, 15-24 h autonomy) assemble factory modules
- **Critical checkpoint:** Energy autonomy within 12-24 hours
- After checkpoint, assembly time is NOT critical — constrained only by Gen-1 lifespan (2-3 years)

**Details:** [First Factory Assembly (Bootstrap)](../detailed/bootstrap.qmd)

### Scenarios

| Scenario | Before checkpoint | After | Total |
|----------|-------------------|-------|-------|
| Optimistic | 12 h | 6 days | **7 days** |
| Realistic | 24 h | 10-15 days | **11-16 days** |
| Pessimistic | 48 h | 20-30 days | **22-32 days** |

### Result
- **Day 7-32: Factory operational!**
- Begins producing Gen-2 robots (15/month)

---

## Week 2-4: Energy Scaling

### What We Do
Factory produces concentrators from local aluminum.

```
Requirement: 100 MW (factory + MD startup)
Needed: 37,000 m^2^ concentrators
Aluminum mass: 2 tons
Production time: ~1 week
```

### Result
- **End of month 1: 100+ MW local energy**
- Starter mirrors from Earth no longer critical

---

- 60 Gen-2 robots accumulated
- 350 MW local energy
- Can launch 600 mirrors/day

---

## Month 6, Day 1: First Launch

### What Happens
```
MD launches first mirror into space
Mirror deploys in orbit
100x100 m = 10,000 m^2^
Reflects 93 MW solar energy
```

### Symbolic Moment
First mirror of the Dyson Swarm. Beginning of a new era.

---

## Month 6-7: Mercury Energy Saturation

### Calculation
```
MD: 600 mirrors/day
In 30 days: 18,000 mirrors

Mirror energy (for base, 50% efficiency):
18,000 x 93 MW x 0.5 = 837,000 MW = 837 GW

Base consumption at this point:
- 1 factory: 5 MW
- 1 MD: 40 MW
- Robots, infrastructure: 10 MW
= 55 MW
```

**Excess: 837,000 / 55 = 15,200x**

### Conclusion
**Within first month of MD operation, energy ceases to be a constraint forever.**

Even per day:
```
600 mirrors x 93 MW x 0.5 = 27,900 MW = 27.9 GW
```
This covers base consumption 500 times over.

---

## Months 5-12: Expansion (with 4 factories)

### Now the Only Constraint - Robot Production

| Resource | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Energy | Infinite (after MD - 13,000x excess) |
| Materials | Infinite (Mercury is rich) |
| **Robots** | **Bottleneck** (60/month for 4 factories) |

### 4 Factory Advantage

```
With 1 factory: 15 robots/month -> slow growth
With 4 factories: 60 robots/month -> 4x faster
```

### Strategy: Build Factories and MDs in Parallel

```
Month 5: 4 factories (60 robots/month) - E2 arrived
Month 6: First MD ready!
Month 7: 8 factories (120 robots/month)
Month 9: 16 factories (240 robots/month)
Month 12: 25 factories (375 robots/month)
```

### Parallel: More MDs

```
Month 6: 1 MD (first!)
Month 8: 3 MDs
Month 10: 6 MDs
Month 12: 12 MDs
```

---

## Year 1: Results (E2 arrived by month 5)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Factories | 25 |
| Robots | 375/month |
| Mass Drivers | 12 |
| Mirrors in Swarm | ~2.5M |
| Swarm power | 205 TW (reflected) |
| To Earth (23% efficiency) | **47 TW** |

**For comparison:** World consumption = 2.3 TW

**Already in one year - 20 times world consumption!**

*(Early E2 launch gives +2 months head start)*

---

## Years 2-3: Exponential Growth

| Year | Factories | MDs | Mirrors in Swarm | To Earth |
|------|-----------|-----|------------------|----------|
| 1 | 25 | 12 | 2.5M | 47 TW |
| 2 | 120 | 80 | 40M | 750 TW |
| 3 | 500 | 400 | 250M | 4,700 TW |
| 3.5 | 1,000 | 800 | 500M | 9,500 TW |
| 4 | **~1,650** | **1,000** | 700M | 13,300 TW |

**Conclusion:** Early E2 launch -> reach ~1650 factories and 1000 MDs in **~4 years**.

---

## Self-Replication: 1 Factory -> ~1650 Factories

**Growth strategy:**
- Each factory produces 15 Gen-2 robots/month
- Robots build new factories and MDs in parallel
- Exponential growth limited only by robot production

**Growth schedule:**
- **Year 1:** 25 factories, 12 MDs (after E2)
- **Year 2:** 120 factories, 80 MDs
- **Year 3:** 500 factories, 400 MDs
- **Year 3.5:** 1000 factories, 800 MDs
- **Year 4:** **~1650 factories, 1000 MDs**

**99% local materials:**
- Robot frames: Al (local)
- Factory structures: Fe (local)
- Mirrors: 4 um Al foil (local)
- Factory domes: silicate composite (local)

**1% import from Earth** ("Vitamins"):
- Electronics: control boards, sensors
- Rare earths: Nd, Sm for magnets
- Copper: for MD coils (critical for conductivity)
- Iridium: MRE anodes

> **More details:** [Production and Self-Replication](../detailed/production.qmd), [Ground Zero Factory](../detailed/production/factories/overview.qmd)

---

## Network of 1000 Mass Drivers

**Each MD parameters:**
- Track length: 2-3 km
- Launch velocity: 5 km/s (Mercury escape velocity)
- Productivity: 600 mirrors/day
- Power consumption: 40 MW peak

**Total network productivity:**
- 1000 MDs x 600 = **600,000 mirrors/day**
- = **219 million mirrors/year**

**MD materials (99% local):**
- Rails: Fe (local)
- Coils: Al + Cu import (critical for conductivity)
- Control electronics: import from Earth

**Single MD construction:**
- Time: ~1 month (with 60+ Gen-2 robots)
- Mass: ~500 t (rails, coils, structures)
- Launch energy: from local concentrators

> **More details:** [Mass Driver: Calculations](../detailed/production/railguns/theory.qmd)

---

## Dyson Swarm - Final Goal

**Swarm parameters:**
- Mirror count: ~1.1 billion active (accounting for 3-5%/year degradation)
- Total area: 1.1x10^13^ m^2^ (~11 million km^2^)
- Mass: ~128 million tons
- Reflected power: ~100 PW
- **Power to Earth: ~21 PW** (18% efficiency via LSP)

**For comparison:**
- World consumption 2026: 2.3 TW
- Dyson Swarm (by year 10): **9,430 TW** = **4100x world consumption**

**Swarm organization:**
- Mirrors in clusters of 1000-10,000
- Each cluster = virtual antenna ~100 km
- Focusing on LSP stations on Moon limbs
- Electrochromic orientation control (no fuel)

**Construction time:**
- ~9.5 years from first factory to 1.1 billion active mirrors
- Mirror degradation already accounted in calculations

**Disposal:**
- Failed mirrors fall into the Sun
- No space debris around Earth

## Year 3: Goal Achieved

### 1000 Mass Drivers

```
Productivity: 1000 x 600 = 600,000 mirrors/day
= 219 million mirrors/year

Energy to Earth:
219M x 93 MW x 0.20 = 4,073 TW/year added

By year 4 in Swarm: ~134M active mirrors
Power: 134M x 93 MW x 0.20 = 2,493 TW ~ 2.5 PW
```

### Comparison

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| World consumption 2026 | 2.3 TW |
| Dyson Swarm (year 3) | 9,430 TW |
| **Ratio** | **4,100x** |

---

## Why Not Infinite Growth

**Criticism:** "Exponential growth is fantasy. You're just drawing pretty tables."

**Response:** Criticism is valid if the goal is infinite growth for growth's sake. But our goal is finite:

### Project Goal

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Target power | ~10,000 TW |
| World consumption | 2.3 TW |
| Margin | 4,000x |
| Time to achieve | **3 years** |

**Why 4000x margin?**
- Mars terraforming (magnetic field)
- Interplanetary logistics
- Population and consumption growth (100 years ahead)
- Space industry

### After Year 3: Maintenance Mode

```
Growth STOPS after reaching goal:
- 1000 MDs operating
- Factories switch to repair and replacement
- New mirrors = replace worn ones
- Vitamin supplies continue
```

### Exponential is Tool, Not Goal

| Phase | Years | Mode | Goal |
|-------|-------|------|------|
| Ramp-up | 0-3 | Exponential growth | Reach 1000 MDs |
| Plateau | 3+ | Maintenance | System operation |

**Main conclusion:** We're not building an infinite machine. We're building infrastructure with a finite goal. Exponential is only needed to reach the goal in reasonable time (3 years instead of 30).

+---------------------------------------------------------+
```

**Key decisions:**
- Moon as proving ground reduces Mercury risk
- "Leap of faith" on Mercury accelerates by ~1 year
- After first MD - energy is infinite, growth limited only by robots

## Known Limitations

> **Attention:** This section describes problems requiring solutions.

### Critical Issues

#### 1. Timelines Are Underestimated

| Phase | Planned timeline | Realistic estimate |
|-------|------------------|-------------------|
| R&D | 2 years | **3-4 years** |
| Earth proving ground | 2 years | **3-4 years** |
| Moon proving ground | 2 years | **3-5 years** |
| Mercury to 1000 MDs | 4 years | **5-7 years** |
| **Total** | **10 years** | **14-20 years** |

**Reasons:**
- Each problem in space -> months of waiting
- AI development is unpredictable (Waymo: 15 years, no full autonomy)
- Political delays not accounted for

#### 2. "Leap of Faith" - High Risk

Launching E2 one month after E1 landing (not waiting for full validation):

| Scenario | Consequences |
|----------|--------------|
| E1 successful | 3 months gained |
| E1 failed | E2 useless (~$1-2B lost) |

**E1 failure probability:** 10-30% (first mission to new planet).

### High Issues

#### 3. Next-Generation Super-Heavy Carriers {#next-generation-super-heavy-carriers}

Project depends on carriers with ~$1,000-2,500/kg cost appearing:

| Carrier | Country | Payload capacity | Expected |
|---------|---------|------------------|----------|
| Starship | USA | 150-200 t | 2027-2030 |
| Long March 9 | China | 150 t | 2030+ |
| Yenisei | Russia | 100 t | 2030+ |
| New Glenn | USA | 45 t | 2025-2026 |
| SHLV | India | ~100 t | 2035+ |

| Assumption | Risk |
|------------|------|
| Target price $1,000-1,500/kg by 2030 | Could be $2,500-3,000/kg |
| 100-150 t to LEO | Real capacity may be lower |

**Consequences:** If super-heavy carrier development delays, project shifts 2-3 years. Risk reduced through diversification: multiple countries developing such carriers in parallel.

#### 4. Lunar Proving Ground May Be Insufficient

| Parameter | Moon | Mercury |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Temperature | -180C...+120C | -180C...**+430C** |
| Solar flux | 1.4 kW/m^2^ | **10 kW/m^2^** |
| Radiation | Moderate | **Extreme** |
| Dust | Abrasive | **Abrasive + charged** |

**Risk:** Moon success doesn't guarantee Mercury success.

### Require Research

#### 5. International Cooperation

- Project requires USA, China, Russia, EU, India participation
- Geopolitical situation 2026 - tense
- Sanctions and export controls block technology transfer

**Scenario:** Competition instead of cooperation -> expense duplication, slowdown.

#### 6. Regulatory Barriers

- Laser energy transmission through atmosphere - requires international agreements
- Frequency regulation for billion mirrors - doesn't exist
- Space debris liability - not defined

### Adjusted Timelines

| Scenario | Total time | Comment |
|----------|------------|---------|
| Optimistic | 10-12 years | Everything goes to plan |
| **Baseline** | **14-16 years** | Moderate delays |
| Conservative | 18-25 years | Serious problems |

**Conclusion:** Realistic timeline to 1000 MDs - **14-16 years**, not 10 years.
