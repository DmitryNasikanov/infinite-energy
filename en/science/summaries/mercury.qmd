## In Development
Summary article on the Mercury phase of the project.
:::

## Contents (Outline)

### Why Mercury?
- Solar flux: 10 kW/m^2 (7x more than Earth)
- No atmosphere -> Mass Driver on surface
- Resources: iron, aluminum, silicon

### "Ground Zero Factory" (Year 6)
- First factory, 100% from Earth
- Self-replication launch

### Self-Replication (Years 6-9)
- 1 factory -> ~1,650 factories
- 60,000 robots
- Exponential growth

### Mirror Production
- Ore mining (Moles)
- Smelting (solar furnaces)
- 4 micron foil rolling
- 100x100 m mirror assembly
- Mass Driver launch

### Dyson Swarm
- ~1 billion mirrors
- Heliocentric orbit
- ~100 petawatts of reflected power
- ~21 petawatts on Earth (~1000x world consumption)
