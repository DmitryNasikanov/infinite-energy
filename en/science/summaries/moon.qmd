The Moon is a key element of the project. Here, **Lunar Solar Power (LSP) stations** receive energy from the Dyson Swarm and transmit it to Earth via [microwaves](../reference/technology-readiness.qmd#microwave-power-transmission).

## Lunar Solar Power (LSP) {#lunar-solar-power}

### Transmission Scheme

```
Dyson Swarm (Mercury) → Light to Moon → PV stations → Microwaves → Earth
```

### Why the Moon Instead of an Orbital Hub?

| Parameter | Orbital Hub (L1) | Moon (LSP) |
|-----------|------------------|------------|
| Efficiency | 10% | **18%** |
| Radiators | 7,900 km² in space | 0 (heat to ground) |
| Structure mass | 15 million tons in orbit | On surface |
| Construction | Zero gravity | Gravity |
| Resources | Delivery | In-situ |

> More details about the energy receiving hub (LSP vs orbital Hub) — [hub.qmd](../detailed/hub.qmd).

### Energy Transmission Efficiency

| Stage | Efficiency | Losses |
|-------|------------|--------|
| Mirror reflection | 90% | 10% |
| Orbital geometry | 72% | 28% |
| Concentration on Moon | 90% | 10% |
| PV at lunar stations | 45% | 55% |
| DC → Microwaves (Klystron) | 90% | 10% |
| Transmission Moon → Earth | 95% | 5% |
| Atmospheric passage | 95% | 5% |
| Rectenna on Earth | 85% | 15% |
| **Total Efficiency** | **18%** | **82%** |

**Calculation:** $\eta = 0.90 \times 0.72 \times 0.90 \times 0.45 \times 0.90 \times 0.95 \times 0.95 \times 0.85 = 0.18$

### Geometry: Why the Limbs?

The Moon is in **tidal lock** — one side always faces Earth. This creates a problem for station placement:

| Position | Sees Swarm? | Sees Earth? |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Near side | Partially | Yes |
| Far side | Yes | No |
| **Limbs (edges)** | **Yes** | **Yes** |

**Solution [Criswell](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329718124_Solar_Power_via_the_Moon_2002):** 20-40 stations on the eastern and western limbs.

```

                     |  |  |
                      \ | /
                       \|/
                        *
                    WESTERN
                      LIMB
```

### Limb Operation Cycle

The lunar month (29.5 days) determines which limb operates:

```
+-- Week 1-2: Western limb illuminated → operates
+-- Week 3-4: Eastern limb illuminated → operates
+-- Transition: 1-2 days overlap, both operate
```

**Result:** Continuous energy transmission with minimal gaps.

### Continuous Power Supply

The Moon is visible from any point on Earth for ~12 hours. Solution — **global rectenna network**:

| Time UTC | Moon above | Active rectenna | Energy goes to |
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------------|
| 00:00 | Pacific Ocean | Australia | Asia |
| 06:00 | India | Gobi (China) | Asia, Europe |
| 12:00 | Africa | Sahara | Europe, Americas |
| 18:00 | Atlantic | Atacama (Chile) | Americas |

**Principle:** Rectenna receives → HVDC cables transmit to global grid → consumers receive continuously.

**Buffering:** 1-2 hour batteries smooth transitions between rectennas.

**Advantage over solar:** The Moon is visible both day and night — easier to ensure continuity than with traditional solar power plants.

### Rectenna on Earth

Large antenna arrays are needed to receive microwaves:

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Area of one rectenna | ~100 km² |
| Quantity | 4-6 (global network) |
| Locations | Deserts: Sahara, Gobi, Atacama, Australia |
| Intensity | 230 W/m² (1/4 of sunlight) |

### Microwave Safety

Microwaves are safer than lasers but require zoning:

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Intensity on rectenna | 230 W/m² |
| Sun at noon | 1000 W/m² |
| US standard (workers) | 100 W/m² |
| Public standard | 10-50 W/m² |

**Why don't microwaves heat the atmosphere?** N₂ and O₂ do not absorb microwaves — they are transparent at 2.45 GHz frequency. A microwave oven heats water, not air. The atmosphere transmits 95% of energy.

**Territory Zoning:**

```
+-------------------------------------+
|         RECTENNA (100+ km²)         |
|  +-------------------------------+  |
|  |   Center: 230 W/m²            |  | <- Restricted zone
|  |   (automation, no people)     |  |
|  +-------------------------------+  |
|        Periphery: <50 W/m²          | <- Technical personnel
+-------------------------------------+
           Border: <10 W/m²            <- Safe for everyone
```

**Birds and aircraft:** NASA confirmed safety at <230 W/m². The system automatically reduces power when objects enter the beam.

## Contents (Plan)

### Why the Moon?
- Test site before Mercury
- 1.3 sec communication delay (vs 8-20 min to Mercury)
- Mistakes are cheaper here

### Testing Ground (Years 4-6)
- Validation of all space technologies
- Robots learn to mine, smelt, build
- Comparison of conditions: Moon vs Mercury

### Test Mass Driver

Prototype of the Mercury Mass Driver for **technology validation**:

- Length: ~15 km (vs 1 km on Mercury)
- Acceleration: 20-25g (vs 1275g on Mercury)
- Speed: 2.5 km/s
- Energy: 3-4 GJ/t (3-4x more efficient)

**Purpose:** validation of design and operations before deployment on Mercury. Mistakes on the Moon are cheaper — 1.3 sec communication delay (vs 8-20 min), 3 days delivery (vs months).

**Why gentler acceleration on the Moon?** Lower escape velocity (2.4 km/s vs 4.3 km/s) allows for extended track length with reduced acceleration forces, serving as a lower-risk proving ground for mass driver technology.

## Historical Note: Building the Orbital Hub

Originally planned to build an **orbital Hub at L1 point** and launch modules via lunar Mass Driver. Concept rejected — instead using **LSP stations on the Moon's surface** (18% vs 10% efficiency, no radiators needed in space).

- Phase 1: Solar panels (14 days of light)
- Phase 2: Energy from Swarm via LSP stations
