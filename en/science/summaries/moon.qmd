## Why the Moon?

The Moon serves **three roles** in the project:

1. **Test site** (years 4-6) — technology validation before Mercury
2. **LSP stations** (years 6+) — receiving energy from the Swarm and transmitting to Earth
3. **Backup site** — less risky alternative to Mercury

### Advantages of the Lunar Test Site

| Parameter | Moon | Mercury |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Communication delay | **1.3 sec** | 8-20 min |
| Cargo delivery | 3 days | Months |
| Cost of mistakes | Low | High |
| Sample return | Possible | Difficult |

**Conclusion:** Mistakes on the Moon are cheaper. Better to debug technologies here.

## Test Site (Years 4-6)

Robots learn to work in space:

- **Mining:** Mole-M excavators dig regolith
- **Smelting:** [MRE](../reference/technology-readiness.qmd#mre-electrolysis) electrolysis for metal extraction
- **Construction:** WAAM 3D printing, structure assembly
- **Energy:** solar panel deployment

**Experience transfers:** Robots tested on Moon adapt for Mercury. Detailed comparison of conditions: [Why Mercury?](comparison.qmd)

## Test Mass Driver

Prototype of Mercury MD for **technology validation**:

| Parameter | Moon (test) | Mercury |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Length | 0.5-1 km | 2-3 km |
| Speed | 2.5 km/s | 5 km/s |
| Acceleration | ~640g | 1275g |
| Energy | 3-4 GJ/t | 12.5 GJ/t |

**Purpose:** Validation of design, cooling system, launch automation.

## Historical Note

Originally planned to launch modules via lunar MD for building an orbital Hub at L1. Concept rejected — instead using **LSP stations on the surface** (18% vs 10% efficiency).

## Energy for the Moon

| Phase | Source | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Years 4-6 | Solar panels | 14 days light / 14 days dark |
| Years 6+ | Energy from Swarm via LSP | After first mirrors launch |

**Night period:** NaS batteries or cables from the illuminated side.

## LSP Stations

The Moon is a key element of the power bridge. **Lunar Solar Power stations** receive light from the Swarm and transmit energy to Earth via [microwaves](../reference/technology-readiness.qmd#microwave-power-transmission).

### Transmission Scheme

```
Dyson Swarm → Light to Moon → PV stations → Microwaves → Earth (rectenna)
```

### Why on the Moon Instead of Orbit?

| Parameter | Orbital Hub | LSP on Moon |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Efficiency | 10% | **18%** |
| Radiators | 7,900 km² in space | 0 (heat to ground) |
| Construction | Zero gravity | Gravity |
| Resources | Delivery | In-situ |

### Location: Lunar Limbs

The Moon is tidally locked — one side always faces Earth. Stations are placed on **limbs** (edges), where both the Swarm and Earth are visible.

**20-40 stations** on eastern and western limbs provide continuous transmission.

## Alternative to Mercury

The Moon is not only a testbed but also a **backup path** for the entire project.

**Key tradeoff:** Mercury is faster (~10 years), Moon is safer (~14 years, but cheaper mistakes). If critical failure on Mercury, production can be fully transferred to the Moon.
