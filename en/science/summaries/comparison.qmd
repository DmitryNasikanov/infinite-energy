## Alternatives

Critics suggest Mars or the Moon as alternatives to Mercury. Let's examine both options.

## Mars: "Closer to Fly"

### Resources: Mars is Richer

| Element | Mercury | Mars |
|---------|---------|------|
| Iron (surface) | ~2% | ~17% |
| Water | Polar craters | Subsurface ice |

At first glance, Mars wins. But resources aren't everything.

### Delivery: Mars is Cheaper!

Delivering an identical factory (62 t), then self-replication from local resources:

| Location | Delta-v | $/kg | Delivery Cost |
|----------|---------|------|---------------|
| Mercury | 8.5 km/s | $2,500 | $155M |
| **Mars** | 5.6 km/s | $1,600 | **$99M** |

### [Mass Driver](../reference/technology-readiness.qmd#electromagnetic-launch-mass-driver): The Main Problem

Mars already has an atmosphere (0.6% of Earth's) - it creates drag at 5 km/s. **Mass Driver is impossible.**

But more importantly - **the project plans to terraform Mars**:

- One of the project's goals is to create a dense atmosphere on Mars
- After terraforming, the atmosphere will become even thicker
- Mass Driver will become completely impossible forever

Alternative - rockets for each mirror:

- Fuel from local resources: CO2 + H2O -> methane
- Additional infrastructure
- Each launch requires energy and resources

### Swarm Orbit: Far from the Sun

The Swarm must be close to the Sun for maximum efficiency.

- **From Mercury:** mirrors are already in the right orbit
- **From Mars:** additional delta-v needed to transfer toward the Sun

### Decommissioning: Where Does the Debris Go?

With a 10-year lifespan, ~110 million mirrors fail annually.

- **Mercury:** mirrors fall into the Sun automatically
- **Mars:** where to? Into Mars orbit - debris. To the Sun - additional energy required.

### Summary for Mars

| Factor | Mercury | Mars |
|--------|---------|------|
| Delivery of 1 factory | $155M | $99M (cheaper!) |
| Mass Driver | Yes | No (rockets needed, terraforming) |
| Swarm orbit | Already there | Transfer to Sun needed |
| Decommissioning | Yes - Sun | ? Problem |
| Project timeline | ~10 years | ~12-15 years |

> **Conclusion:** Mars is cheaper for delivery but more expensive for operations - no Mass Driver, rockets needed for each mirror.

## Moon: "Already Nearby"

### Delivery: The Cheapest

| Location | Delta-v | $/kg | Delivery Cost |
|----------|---------|------|---------------|
| Mercury | 8.5 km/s | $2,500 | $155M |
| **Moon** | 5.5 km/s | $1,500 | **$93M** |

### Swarm in Lunar Orbit?

If launching mirrors not to Earth orbit but to lunar orbit - debris doesn't threaten Earth.

**Capacity calculation:**

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Moon's Hill sphere | ~60,000 km |
| Stable orbits | up to ~20,000 km from Moon |
| Sphere area at r=10,000 km | 1.26x10^9 km^2 |
| Mirror 100x100 m | 0.01 km^2 |
| At density 1 mirror/10 km^2 | ~126 million mirrors/layer |
| 10 orbital layers | **~1.26 billion mirrors** |

**Space is sufficient!** But there's a problem - **efficiency is 7x lower:**

| Location | Solar flux | Relative efficiency |
|----------|------------|---------------------|
| Mercury | 10,000 W/m^2 | 100% |
| Lunar orbit | 1,361 W/m^2 | **14%** |

For the same power, **7 times more mirrors** are needed - that's ~8 billion units. Won't fit.

**Decommissioning:** with 8 billion mirrors, ~800 million units fail annually (~93 million tons).

| Option | Fuel/year | Assessment |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| To Sun (dv 3.5 km/s) | 240M t | Unrealistic |
| Drop to Moon (dv 0.6 km/s) | 16M t | Possible, but recycling requires 74 GW |
| Leave in orbit | 0 | Works (Kessler unlikely), but long-term pollution |

On Mercury, mirrors fall into the Sun automatically - **decommissioning is free**.

**Conclusion:** The Moon can be used as a temporary solution:

- Efficiency 7x lower -> higher deployment costs for the Swarm
- Debris disposal problem requires resolution over time
- But as a first phase or testbed for technology validation - it works

### Risk of Altering the Earth-Moon System

**Physics:**

- Moon's mass: 7.35x10^22 kg
- Even extracting billions of tons - mass change ~10^-13 (imperceptible)
- Moon's orbit doesn't depend on its mass (Kepler's Third Law)

**Politics:**

- Large-scale mining will raise public concerns
- "You're destroying the Moon!" - opponents' argument
- Mercury doesn't have this problem

### Summary for Moon

| Factor | Mercury | Moon |
|--------|---------|------|
| Delivery of 1 factory | $155M | $93M (cheaper!) |
| Mass Driver | Yes | Yes |
| Space debris | Yes - Sun | No - **Earth orbit** |
| Political risk | None | "Destroying the Moon!" |
| Project timeline | ~10 years | ~10-12 years* |

*Timeline is conditional - efficiency 7x lower, space debris requires resolution over time

> **The Moon can be used temporarily** - less efficient, more expensive to deploy, requires solving the debris problem. But as a first step before Mercury - a viable option.

## Overall Comparison

| Parameter | Mercury | Mars | Moon |
|-----------|---------|------|------|
| Solar flux | **10,000 W/m^2** | 590 W/m^2 | 1,361 W/m^2 |
| Delta-v from Earth | 8.5 km/s | 5.6 km/s | 5.5 km/s |
| Delivery of 1 factory | $155M | $99M | $93M |
| Mass Driver | Yes | No (atmosphere) | Yes |
| Debris disposal | Yes - Sun | ? Problem | No - Earth orbit |
| **Project timeline** | **~10 years** | ~12-15 years | ~10-12 years* |

*Moon: temporary solution - efficiency 7x lower, requires solving space debris problem

## Why Mercury Anyway?

### 1. Mass Driver

Mercury has no atmosphere -> mirrors are launched by Mass Driver directly from the surface.

On Mars, rockets are needed:
- Fuel production (methane from CO2 + H2O)
- Launch infrastructure
- Energy for each launch

### 2. Swarm Orbit

The Swarm is on a heliocentric orbit close to the Sun.

- **From Mercury:** mirrors are already where they need to be
- **From Mars:** delta-v ~15 km/s needed for transfer to the Sun

### 3. Decommissioning

With 1.1 billion mirrors and a 10-year lifespan, ~110 million units fail annually.

- **Mercury:** fall into the Sun automatically (self-disposal when functionality is lost)
- **Mars/Moon:** create space debris
