## Alternatives

Critics suggest Mars or the Moon as alternatives to Mercury. Let's examine both options.

## Mars: "Closer to Fly"

### Resources: Mars is Richer

| Element | Mercury | Mars |
|---------|---------|------|
| Iron (surface) | ~2% | ~17% |
| Water | Polar craters | Subsurface ice |

At first glance, Mars wins. But resources aren't everything.

### Delivery: Mars is Cheaper!

Delivering an identical factory (62 t), then self-replication from local resources:

| Location | Delta-v | $/kg | Delivery Cost |
|----------|---------|------|---------------|
| Mercury | 8.5 km/s | $2,500 | $155M |
| **Mars** | 5.6 km/s | $1,600 | **$99M** |

### [Mass Driver](../reference/glossary.qmd#mass-driver): The Main Problem

Mars already has an atmosphere (0.6% of Earth's) - it creates drag at 5 km/s. **Mass Driver is impossible.**

But more importantly - **the project plans to terraform Mars**:

- One of the project's goals is to create a dense atmosphere on Mars
- After terraforming, the atmosphere will become even thicker
- Mass Driver will become completely impossible forever

Alternative - rockets for each mirror:

- Fuel from local resources: CO2 + H2O -> methane
- Additional infrastructure
- Each launch requires energy and resources

### Swarm Orbit: Far from the Sun

The Swarm must be close to the Sun for maximum efficiency.

- **From Mercury:** mirrors are already in the right orbit
- **From Mars:** additional delta-v needed to transfer toward the Sun

### Decommissioning: Where Does the Debris Go?

With a 10-year lifespan, ~110 million mirrors fail annually.

- **Mercury:** mirrors fall into the Sun automatically
- **Mars:** where to? Into Mars orbit - debris. To the Sun - additional energy required.

### Summary for Mars

| Factor | Mercury | Mars |
|--------|---------|------|
| Delivery of 1 factory | $155M | $99M (cheaper!) |
| Mass Driver | Yes | No (rockets needed, terraforming) |
| Swarm orbit | Already there | Transfer to Sun needed |
| Decommissioning | Yes - Sun | ? Problem |
| Project timeline | ~10 years | ~12-15 years |

> **Conclusion:** Mars is cheaper for delivery but more expensive for operations - no Mass Driver, rockets needed for each mirror.

## Moon: A Serious Alternative

### Delivery: The Cheapest

| Location | Delta-v | $/kg | Delivery Cost |
|----------|---------|------|---------------|
| Mercury | 8.5 km/s | $2,500 | $155M |
| **Moon** | 5.5 km/s | $1,500 | **$93M** |

### Resources: Aluminum

| Element | Mercury | Moon (highlands) | Moon (mare) |
|---------|---------|------------------|-------------|
| **Al** | ~7% | ~14% (anorthosite) | ~6% (basalt) |
| Si | ~24.6% | ~21% | ~21% |
| Fe | 1.5-2% | ~5% | ~14% |

Aluminum on the Moon is sufficient. MRE (Molten Regolith Electrolysis) TRL 5-6 works with lunar regolith.

### Mass Driver: Simpler Than Mercury

| Parameter | Mercury | Moon | Moon's Advantage |
|-----------|---------|------|------------------|
| Velocity | 4.3 km/s | 2.4 km/s | **1.8x lower** |
| Acceleration | 1275g | ~640g | **~2x lower** |
| Energy per launch | 3.6 GJ | 0.35 GJ | **10x less** |
| Wear | High | Moderate | Longer service life |

Lunar Mass Driver is simpler, more reliable, and more economical.

### Energy: Mirrors Solve the Problem

Solar flux on the Moon is 7x lower. Is this a problem?

**No.** Swarm mirrors direct light to lunar factories:

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Factory consumption | ~124 MW |
| 100 mirrors -> Moon | 9,300 MW solar |
| At 18% efficiency | **1,674 MW** |
| **Surplus** | **~13x** |

After launching the first ~100 mirrors, energy is no longer a constraint.

### Communication and Iterations: Critical Advantage

| Parameter | Moon | Mercury | Moon's Advantage |
|-----------|------|---------|------------------|
| Communication delay | 1.3 sec | 8-20 min | **Real-time** |
| Delivery time | 3 days | 3-4 months | **Fast iterations** |
| Cost of error | ~$100-200M | ~$500M-1B | **5x cheaper** |

Error on the Moon: fix in a month. On Mercury: wait a quarter.

### Receiving Infrastructure: Simpler

In the lunar scenario, the Swarm orbits the Moon/Earth, not Mercury. This radically changes the energy transmission geometry:

| Scenario | Distance to receivers | Beam spreading | LSP area |
|----------|----------------------|----------------|----------|
| **Mercury** | ~100 million km | ~1 km | 5-10 km |
| **Moon** | ~100-400 thousand km | **~10 m** | **~100 m** |

Smaller beam spreading → compact receivers → cheaper infrastructure. Details: [Energy Receiving Hub](../detailed/hub.qmd#beam-spreading)

### Decommissioning: Requires Solution

| Option | Delta-v | Feasibility |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Drop to Moon surface | 0.6 km/s | **Possible** |
| Leave in lunar orbit | 0 | Works (low density) |
| To Sun | 3 km/s | Unrealistic |

On Mercury, mirrors fall into the Sun automatically - decommissioning is free.

### Political Risk

- **Moon:** Outer Space Treaty 1967 - "province of all mankind." Large-scale mining may cause disputes.
- **Mercury:** No such attention, mining won't cause protests.

### Summary for Moon

| Factor | Mercury | Moon |
|--------|---------|------|
| Delivery | $155M | **$93M** ✓ |
| Mass Driver | Harder (1275g) | **Simpler (~640g)** ✓ |
| Energy | Sufficient | **Sufficient** (mirrors) ✓ |
| Communication | 8-20 min | **1.3 sec** ✓ |
| Iterations | Months | **Days** ✓ |
| LSP receivers | 5-10 km (spreading ~1 km) | **~100 m** ✓ |
| Decommissioning | ✓ Sun | Requires solution |
| Time to goal | **~10 years** ✓ | ~14 years |
| Politics | No issues | Possible disputes |

> **The Moon is a serious alternative.** Technically simpler, cheaper for iterations, but scales slower and requires solving decommissioning.

## Tradeoff: Speed vs Risk

| Strategy | Timeline | Risk | When to choose |
|----------|----------|------|----------------|
| **Mercury** | ~10 years | High (errors $500M-1B) | Maximum speed, willing to risk |
| **Moon** | ~14 years | Low (errors $100-200M) | Guaranteed result more important than speed |

**Optimal strategy:** Moon as testbed + backup (years 4-6), Mercury for scaling (years 6+). If critical failure on Mercury, production transfers to Moon — project completes later but is guaranteed.

## Overall Comparison

| Parameter | Mercury | Mars | Moon |
|-----------|---------|------|------|
| Solar flux | **~9,300 W/m^2** | 590 W/m^2 | 1,361 W/m^2 |
| Delta-v from Earth | 8.5 km/s | 5.6 km/s | **5.5 km/s** |
| Delivery of 1 factory | $155M | $99M | **$93M** |
| Mass Driver | ✓ (1275g) | ✗ (atmosphere) | **✓ (~640g)** |
| Energy for factories | ✓ | ✓ | **✓ (mirrors)** |
| Communication | 8-20 min | 4-24 min | **1.3 sec** |
| Debris disposal | ✓ Sun | ? Problem | Requires solution |
| **Time to goal** | **~10 years** | ~15 years | ~14 years |

**Conclusion:**

- **Mercury** — optimal for scaling (energy, disposal, speed)
- **Moon** — optimal for testbed (communication, iterations, simpler MD)
- **Mars** — not suitable (no MD after terraforming)

## Why Mercury for Scaling?

### 1. Speed to Goal

| Location | Time to 1.1 billion mirrors |
|----------|-----------------------------|
| Mercury | ~10 years |
| Moon | ~14 years |

The 4-year difference means 4 more years of global warming.

### 2. Free Decommissioning

With 1.1 billion mirrors and a 10-year lifespan, ~110 million units fail annually.

- **Mercury:** fall into the Sun automatically
- **Moon:** requires solution (surface drop or special orbits)

### 3. Energy for Scaling

Solar flux 7x higher = faster factory self-replication. Critical in early stages (before ~100 mirrors).
