***

### NaS Batteries

**Project Application:** Power system for Gen-2 robots on Mercury.

**Existing Implementations:**

| Project | Country | Capacity | Year |
|--------|--------|----------|-----|
| [NGK globally](https://www.energy-storage.news/nas-batteries-long-duration-energy-storage-proven-at-5gwh-of-deployments-worldwide/) | Japan | **5 GWh**, 250+ projects | since 2003 |
| [Toho Gas](https://www.energy-storage.news/ngk-sodium-sulfur-batteries-deployed-at-70mwh-japan-project-picked-for-pilot-by-us-utility-duke-energy/) | Japan | 11.4 MW / 69.6 MWh | 2024 |
| HH2E | Germany | 230+ MWh (green H₂) | 2024 |

**Characteristics:** Operating temperature 300-350°C, [**7,300 cycles**](https://www.basf.com/global/en/media/news-releases/2024/06/p-24-216), 20-year lifespan, <1% degradation/year.

**Ideal for Mercury:** NaS requires heating to 300°C. On Mercury's day side +400°C — **free heating**. In shadow (-180°C) heat from NaS helps robots operate. This is not a bug, it's a feature.

***

### WAAM (Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing)

**Project Application:** Production of robot frames, factory parts, Mass Driver elements.

**Existing Implementations:**

| Company | Country | Technology | Application |
|----------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| [WAAM3D](https://www.waam3d.com/) | UK | Industrial WAAM | Large Al/Ti parts |
| [AML3D](https://aml3d.com/technology) | Australia | WAM® — no chamber | [First DNV-certification](https://www.metal-am.com/aml3ds-wire-arc-additive-manufacturing-selected-for-use-in-naval-shipbuilding/), shipbuilding |
| [RAMLAB](https://www.ramlab.com/resources/waam-101/) | Netherlands | WAAM for ships | Propellers, hulls |
| Lincoln Electric + MX3D | USA/Netherlands | Multi-wire WAAM | Bridges, structures |

**Characteristics:** 1-10 kg/hour deposition rate, aluminum/steel/titanium, **no vacuum chamber** (important for Mercury — working in vacuum is even better!).

**Conclusion:** WAAM in Mercury's vacuum = ideal conditions (no oxidation). Technology is mature and industrial.

***

### Electromagnetic Launch (Mass Driver)

**Project Application:** Launching mirrors from Mercury's surface at 5 km/s.

**Key Demonstrations:**

| Project | Speed | Details |
|--------|----------|--------|
| [China NUDT (Dec 2025)](https://news.cgtn.com/news/2025-12-25/China-sets-world-record-in-maglev-tech-with-700-km-h-in-2-seconds-1JoGe1RA7T2/p.html) | **700 km/h in 2 sec** | 400 m track, ton-class, [superconducting](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3337735/chinas-record-smashing-maglev-achieves-0-700km/h-acceleration-less-2-seconds) |
| [EMALS (US Navy)](https://www.navair.navy.mil/product/Electromagnetic-Aircraft-Launch-System-EMALS) | **23,000+ launches** | Production catapult, [combat deployment 2023-24](https://www.flightglobal.com/fixed-wing/uss-gerald-r-fords-emals-cleared-for-all-aircraft/136773.article) |
| Fujian (Chinese Navy) | — | Indigenous EMALS |
| [NASA Mass Driver (1977)](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19770010564) | Concept | Original Gerard O'Neill idea |

**Quote from Professor Li Jie (NUDT):** *"Going forward, we will focus on frontier fields such as high-speed maglev transport in pipelines, aerospace boost launches and experimental testing."*

**Scaling for project:** NUDT achieved 700 km/h (194 m/s) over 400 m. Project requires 5,000 m/s over 3 km. Same physics — need to scale power system and track length. Linear motor is an induction machine, principle is identical at any speed.

**Conclusion:** EMALS is in serial production for aircraft carriers, maglev is commercially operated in China and Japan. Scaling to 5 km/s is an engineering task, not a scientific one.

***

### Ultra-thin Aluminum Foil

**Project Application:** Swarm Mirrors — 4 μm aluminum foil, 110 kg per mirror.

**Industrial Precedents:**

| Project/Product | Thickness | Status |
|----------------|---------|--------|
| [LightSail 2](https://www.planetary.org/articles/what-is-solar-sailing) (Planetary Society) | **4.5 μm** | [Flew in space (2019)](https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/smallsat/2023/all2023/59/) |

| [SK Nexilis](https://www.metal.com/en/newscontent/103281418) (Malaysia) | Ultra-thin | 30,000 tons/year (new plant 2024) |

**Conclusion:** LightSail 2 proved 4.5 μm foil viability in space. NEA Scout used even thinner — 2.5 μm. This is no longer R&D, but flight-proven technology.

***

**Principle:** Regolith melts at ~1600°C, electric current separates oxides into oxygen (anode) and metals (cathode): Fe, Si, Al, Ti. Requires no reagents or additives from Earth.

***

### Microwave Power Transmission

**Project Application:** Power transmission from LSP stations on Moon to rectenna on Earth.

**Key Demonstrations:**

| Project | Achievement | Year |
|--------|-----------|-----|
| [Caltech SSPP/MAPLE](https://www.caltech.edu/about/news/in-a-first-caltechs-space-solar-power-demonstrator-wirelessly-transmits-power-in-space) | **First ever** [power transmission from space to Earth](https://spectrum.ieee.org/space-based-solar-power) | May 2023 |
| NTT + MHI (Japan) | 152W over 1 km (world ground record) | — |

***

### Autonomous AI for Robots

**Project Application:** Fully autonomous operation of Mole-M, Crab, and Centaur robots with 8-20 minute communication delay.

**Key Demonstrations:**

| Project | Achievement | Source |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| [Mars Perseverance](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/autonomous-systems-help-nasas-perseverance-do-more-science-on-mars/) | 90% of 32.1 km autonomous, 4-24 min delay | NASA JPL |
| [Perseverance AutoNav](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.adi3099) | Record: 411.7 m/day, 699.9 m without manual control | Science Robotics |
| [Waymo](https://waymo.com/blog/2025/12/demonstrably-safe-ai-for-autonomous-driving) | 100+ million autonomous miles, SAE Level 4 | Waymo |
| [Waymo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waymo) | 450K+ rides/week in 5 cities | Wikipedia |
| Rio Tinto | 305 trucks, 8.9M hours autonomous operation | See above |

**Key Clarification:** Regolith mining is **SIMPLER** than city driving or Mars navigation:

- No pedestrians, intersections, dynamic obstacles
- No atmosphere, dust storms (unlike Mars)
- Predictable environment: quarry with known terrain
- Rio Tinto already mines 24/7 autonomously

**Conclusion:** Perseverance demonstrates autonomy with 4-24 min delay on another planet — this is TRL 7-8. Waymo Level 4 in 5 cities — TRL 8-9. Mercury task is simpler than both. TRL 6-7 is a conservative estimate.

***

## Technologies TRL 3-4 (Open Questions)

::: {.callout-warning}
## These technologies require additional development
Below are technologies that have no direct industrial precedent. For each, nearest analogues and validation plan are provided.
:::

### Factory Self-replication

**Requirement:** Factory produces components for building a new factory.

**Nearest Analogues:**
- FANUC: robots build robots (50 units/day, 30 days without humans)
- Semiconductor fabs produce lithographic equipment for new fabs
- Tesla Gigafactory: contains equipment for producing equipment

**Key Clarification:** This is NOT replication in the Von Neumann sense. This is serial automated construction of standard modules. Dome, furnaces, rolling mill — all standard metallurgical equipment.

**Critical Question:** What % of factory equipment is produced on-site? Answer: ~99.95% by mass. "Vitamins" (chips, sensors, iridium) — <0.05%.

**Status:** Requires engineering development, but not scientific breakthrough.

***

### Coordination of 1 Billion Mirror Swarm

**Requirement:** 1.1 billion mirrors in heliocentric orbit aim at LSP stations.

**Key Clarification:** This is NOT a swarm coordination task. Each mirror is an independent controller. Task reduces to:
1. Know your position (sun sensor + ephemeris)
2. Know direction to target (uploaded tables)
3. Orient yourself (electrochromics, light pressure)

**Analogues:**
- Starlink: 6,000+ satellites, autonomous orbit correction
- GPS: 31 satellites with precision orbits
- IoT: billions of devices with autonomous controllers

**Status:** Engineering scaling problem, not scientific problem.

***

### In-situ Silicon Cells

**Requirement:** Production of solar cells from regolith silicon on Mercury.

**Key Reference:** Blue Origin [Blue Alchemist](https://www.blueorigin.com/news/blue-alchemist-technology/) — complete cycle: regolith → MRE → Si purification → solar cells. Demonstration 2023.

**Clarification:** For Mercury's power system, 10-15% efficiency is sufficient (solar flux 10 kW/m²). This requires 99.99% purity (four nines), not 99.9999% (six nines). Zone melting in Mercury's vacuum = ideal conditions.

***

### Cryogenic Aluminum Cable (GW)

**Requirement:** GW power transmission through Al cables at -180°C.

**Physics:** At -180°C Al conductivity increases [10-100×](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/TN/nbstechnicalnote218.pdf) (depends on purity). This is not a hypothesis — this is NIST tabulated data.

**Analogues:**
- [LHC (CERN)](https://home.web.cern.ch/science/engineering/cryogenics-low-temperatures-high-performance): kilometers of cables at 1.9K (NbTi)
- [HL-LHC](https://cerncourier.com/a/new-superconducting-technologies-for-the-hl-lhc-and-beyond/): MgB₂ cables 100m, 120 kA at 25K
- High-temperature superconductors: commercial cables at -196°C (liquid N₂)

**Clarification:** On Mercury's night side temperature is -180°C — cables are cooled for free.
