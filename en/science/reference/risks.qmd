|------|----------|---------|
| Phased array synchronization | Local clusters of 1000-10000 mirrors | [Swarm Mirrors](../detailed/mirrors.qmd#mirror-clusters) |
| Electrochromics too slow | Sufficient for cluster architecture | [Ultra-thin foil TRL 5-7](technology-readiness.qmd#ultra-thin-aluminum-foil) |
| Copper not found on Mercury | Cryo-aluminum in shadow (-180C) | [Cryogenic Al](technology-readiness.qmd#cryogenic-aluminum-cable-gw) |

## Technological Risks

### TRL 3-4 Technologies

Require additional development but are not fundamentally new.

| Technology | TRL | Status | Closest Analog |
|------------|-----|--------|----------------|
| [Factory self-replication](technology-readiness.qmd#factory-self-replication) | 3-4 | Engineering task | FANUC: robots build robots |
| [Autonomous robot AI](technology-readiness.qmd#autonomous-ai-for-robots) | 4-5 | Complicated by communication delay | Rio Tinto: 690 trucks |
| [In-situ silicon cells](technology-readiness.qmd#in-situ-silicon-cells) | 3-4 | R&D | Blue Origin Blue Alchemist |
| [Cryogenic Al GW cable](technology-readiness.qmd#cryogenic-aluminum-cable-gw) | 4 | Physics confirmed | CERN LHC cryogenics |

**Details:** [Technologies and Sources - TRL 3-4](technology-readiness.qmd#trl-3-4-technologies-open-questions)

### Open Technical Issues

#### Iridium for MRE Anodes (Critical)

**Problem:** MRE anodes are consumed and require replacement every 6 months.

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Anode mass | ~20 kg iridium |
| For 1000 factories over 10 years | ~400 tons |
| World production | ~7 t/year |
| **Deficit** | **~6x world production** |

**Primary path - Cr-Fe-Co anodes:**

- Lower lifespan (replacement every 3 months), but materials available on Mercury
- 80 t/year local production instead of iridium import
- TRL ~4, requires validation

**Alternatives:** Carbon consumable (TRL ~3), H2 reduction (TRL ~2)

**Status:** Serious problem - Cr-Fe-Co most likely solution

---

#### Energy Bridge Efficiency

| Stage | Calculated | Pessimistic |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| Light - laser | 60% | 40-50% |
| Receiver (PV) | 50% | 35-45% |
| Atmosphere | 85% | 30-60% |
| **Total** | **22-23%** | **10-15%** |

**Compensation:** 50-100x redundancy (even at 10% efficiency - 1000 TW = 50x world consumption)

**Details:** [Swarm Mirrors](../detailed/mirrors.qmd#energy-transmission-efficiency-via-lunar-lsp-stations)

---

#### Mirror Degradation

| Parameter | Calculated | Pessimistic |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Lifespan | 10-15 years | 5-8 years |
| Efficiency loss/year | 2-5% | 5-10% |

**Causes:** Solar wind 10x, micrometeorites (JWST showed the problem), electrostatics.

**Solution:** "Add, don't replace" strategy - production of 219 million/year compensates for degradation.

---

#### Mirror Thermal Expansion

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Delta-T during rotation | up to 88 K |
| Edge displacement 100 m (Al) | ~20 cm |

**Solution:** Carbon fiber frame (CTE ~1x10^-6) - displacement ~1 cm. Import ~0.5 t/factory.

---

#### Mercury Resources (MESSENGER Data)

| Element | In Project | MESSENGER | Status |
|---------|------------|-----------|--------|
| Fe | ~5% | **1.5-2%** | 2.5x less |
| Si | ~20% | ~24.6% | Sufficient |
| Al | Sufficient | Lower than Moon | Moderate |

**Consequence:** Process 2.5x more regolith for iron. Mirrors from Al - iron only for robots.

---

#### First Factory Assembly Time

| Scenario | Assembly | Schedule Shift |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| Optimistic | 7 days | 0 |
| Realistic | 30 days | +1 month |
| Pessimistic | 60 days | +2 months |

**Why not critical:** One-time delay, ~2% of 10-year schedule.

---

## Budget Risks

### AI Budget Underestimated

| Parameter | Baseline | Realistic |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Cost | $15-30 billion | **$50-100 billion** |
| Timeline | 5-7 years | **8-12 years** |

**References:**

- Waymo: $11 billion over 15 years - no full autonomy
- Tesla FSD: $15+ billion over 8 years - level 2
- Mercury conditions are harder: vacuum, radiation, 5-20 min delay

---

### Dependence on Super-Heavy Rockets

Baseline scenario: $2,500/kg with Starship/Long March 9 availability by 2030.

| Scenario | Cost | Impact |
|----------|------|--------|
| Rockets on time | $2,500/kg | - |
| 2-3 year delay | $3,500/kg | **+$30-50 billion** |

---

### Mission Insurance

| Estimate | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| Baseline | $2-4 billion |
| Realistic (5-10% of cargo) | **$10-20 billion** |

---

### Testing Underestimated

| Stage | Baseline | Realistic |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| Factory prototypes | 3-5 iterations | 10-20 iterations |
| Robot prototypes | $2 billion | $5-10 billion |
| Lunar testbed | 2 years | 3-5 years |

**Details:** [Budget - Known Limitations](../summaries/budget.qmd#known-limitations)

---

## Human Risks

### Personnel

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Total specialists | ~50,000 people |
| AI/ML engineers | ~4,000 |
| Mission control operators | ~10,000 |
| Training time | 5 years |

### Competition for AI Specialists

- OpenAI salaries: median $875K/year
- Top researchers: $10-20M/year
- Project competes with Google, Meta, OpenAI for the same people

### International Teams

- **Language barrier:** China, Russia, India, USA, EU
- **Time zones:** 24/7 coordination
- **Cultural differences:** Management styles, decision-making
- **Visa restrictions:** Specialist mobility

### Staff Retention

- 10+ year project - people leave
- Unique skills - few market analogs
- Burnout on long projects

---

## Political Risks

### Sanctions and International Tensions

| Scenario | Consequence |
|----------|-------------|
| US-China sanctions expand | Electronics cooperation breakdown |
| Sanctions against Russia | Loss of rocket capacity |
| Chip export controls | Component shortage |

### Government Changes

- **10+ year project** - minimum 2-3 electoral cycles
- New administrations may reconsider priorities
- Reference: Artemis cancelled/restored programs

### Competition Instead of Cooperation

| Cooperation | Competition |
|-------------|-------------|
| 1 project, shared budget | 2-3 parallel projects |
| ~$500-700 billion | ~$1.5-2 trillion total |

### Legal Status of Resources

- **Outer Space Treaty 1967:** Celestial bodies not subject to appropriation
- **Artemis Accords (2020):** USA recognizes right to extraction
- **China/Russia:** Did not sign Artemis Accords
- **Risk:** Disputes over rights to Mercury resources

### Public Opinion

- "Why not solve Earth problems?"
- Environmental protests against rectenna stations
- NIMBYism with receiver placement

---

## Resource Constraints

### Tungsten

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Requirement (10 years) | ~18,000 t |
| World production | 85,000 t/year |
| **Share** | **~2%/year** |

### Electronics

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Chips for 1 trillion mirrors | ~1 trillion |
| World production | ~1.2 trillion/year |
| **Share (over 10 years)** | **~8%/year** |

### Launch Capacity

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Cargo to Mercury | ~20,000 t |
| At 200 t/launch | ~100 launches over 10 years |
| **Launches/year** | **~10-20** |

---

## Uncertainties

Require additional research:

1. **Venus gravity influence** on swarm orbits - not modeled
2. **Electronics production on Mercury** - theoretically possible, not designed
3. **Hydrogen extraction from poles** - ice confirmed, logistics not designed
4. **Aluminothermy in vacuum** - laboratory data, industrial scale not proven
5. **NaS behavior during 176-day cycle** - no data on such regimes
