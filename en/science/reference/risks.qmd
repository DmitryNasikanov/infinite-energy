## Resolved Risks

These issues initially appeared blocking but have solutions.

| Risk | Solution | Details |
|------|----------|---------|
| Phased array synchronization | Local clusters of 1000-10000 mirrors | [Swarm Mirrors](../detailed/mirrors.qmd#mirror-clusters) |
| Electrochromics too slow | Sufficient for cluster architecture | [Electrochromic TiO₂ TRL 6-7](technology-readiness.qmd#electrochromic-tio₂) |
| Copper not found on Mercury | Cryo-aluminum in shadow (-180C) | [Cryogenic Al](technology-readiness.qmd#cryogenic-aluminum-cable-gw) |
| NaS batteries during night period | Cables + charging stations | [NaS TRL 9](technology-readiness.qmd#nas-batteries) |
| **Payload survivability at high g** | Proven to 25,000g (McCormick Stevenson) | [MD Theory](../detailed/production/railguns/theory.qmd#payload-survivability-at-high-g) |

## Technological Risks

### TRL 4-5 Technologies

Require additional development but are not fundamentally new. All subsystems proven (TRL 9), the challenge is integration.

| Technology | TRL | Status | Closest Analog |
|------------|-----|--------|----------------|
| [Factory self-replication](technology-readiness.qmd#factory-self-replication) | 4-5 | Subsystems TRL 9, integration is engineering task | FANUC: robots build robots |
| [Cryogenic Al GW cable](technology-readiness.qmd#cryogenic-aluminum-cable-gw) | 4-5 | NIST physics, superconducting analogues TRL 5-6 | CERN LHC cryogenics |

> **Note:** Autonomous robot AI upgraded to TRL 6-7 based on Mars Perseverance, Waymo, and Rio Tinto demonstrations. In-situ silicon cells upgraded to TRL 5-6 (Blue Alchemist CDR 2025, Maana Electric ISRU panel 2024). Self-replication and cryogenic cable upgraded to TRL 4-5 (all subsystems have industrial precedents).

### Open Technical Issues

#### Iridium for MRE Anodes (Critical)

**Problem:** MRE anodes are consumed and require replacement every 6 months.

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Anode mass | ~20 kg iridium |
| For 1000 factories over 10 years | ~400 tons |
| World production | ~7 t/year |
| **Deficit** | **~6x world production** |

**Scale of the problem:** At full scale of 1650 factories (20 MRE cells × 4 anodes × 2 kg), initial loading requires ~264 t of iridium and ~330 t/year for replacement — over 40x world production. Iridium import is feasible only in early stages (single-digit factories); at scale, transition to local anodes is **mandatory**.

**Solutions (local materials):**

1. **Carbon anodes** — consumable, ~10 kg/day per factory. Carbon is mined from Mercury's LRM zones ([details](../detailed/production/materials/carbon.qmd)). Full chain developed: graphite mining → mini-MD delivery → anodes. Demand is covered.
2. **Cr-Fe-Co anodes** — lower lifespan (replacement every 3 months), but materials available on Mercury. 80 t/year local production. TRL ~4, requires validation.
3. **H₂ reduction** — TRL ~2, prospective alternative.

**Status:** Problem is solvable — carbon anodes from local materials are the most developed path

#### Energy Bridge Efficiency

| Stage | Calculated | Pessimistic |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| Light - laser | 60% | 40-50% |
| Receiver (PV) | 50% | 35-45% |
| Atmosphere | 85% | 30-60% |
| **Total** | **22-23%** | **10-15%** |

**Compensation:** 50-100x redundancy (even at 10% efficiency - 1000 TW = 50x world consumption)

**Details:** [Swarm Mirrors](../detailed/mirrors.qmd#energy-transmission-efficiency-via-lunar-lsp-stations)

---

#### Mirror Degradation

| Parameter | Calculated | Pessimistic |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Lifespan | 10-15 years | 5-8 years |
| Efficiency loss/year | 2-5% | 5-10% |

**Causes:** Solar wind 10x, micrometeorites (JWST showed the problem), electrostatics.

**Solution:** "Add, don't replace" strategy - production of 219 million/year compensates for degradation.

---

#### Mirror Thermal Expansion

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Delta-T during rotation | up to 88 K |
| Edge displacement 100 m (Al) | ~20 cm |

**Solution:** Carbon fiber frame (CTE ~1x10^-6) - displacement ~1 cm. Import ~0.5 t/factory.

---

#### Mercury Resources (MESSENGER Data)

| Element | Demand | In Regolith (MESSENGER) | Status |
|---------|--------|-------------------------|--------|
| Al | 42 t/day (7%) — mirrors, windings | ~7% (from feldspars) | **Sufficient** |
| Si | 25 t/day (4%) — solar panels | ~24.6% | Sufficient with margin |
| Fe | 10 t/day (~2%) — robot frames | 1.5-2% | Sufficient (production designed for 2%) |

**Conclusion:** Primary material — aluminum (~95% of mirror mass). The production chain ([distillation](../detailed/production/materials/distillation.qmd)) is designed around actual regolith composition per MESSENGER data. No deficit of bulk elements.

---

#### First Factory Assembly Time

**Critical checkpoint:** Energy autonomy (12-24 hours)

After checkpoint, assembly time is NOT critical — constraint is only Gen-1 lifespan (2-3 years).

| Scenario | Before checkpoint | After | **Total** | Rationale |
|----------|-------------------|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Optimistic | 12 h | 6 days | **7 days** | Everything works perfectly |
| Realistic | 24 h | 10-15 days | **11-16 days** | Typical delays |
| Pessimistic | 48 h | 20-30 days | **22-32 days** | Equipment issues |

**Key insight:**

- **Old model:** "7 days critical, 30 = failure"
- **New model:** "24 hours critical, rest = Gen-1 lifespan question"

After charging infrastructure deployment (checkpoint), robots can work 24/7 with recharging. Even 30-day assembly keeps the project viable.

## Budget Risks

### AI Cost Declining (Risk Resolved)

Baseline estimate ($15-30 billion) was conservative. By 2026:

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Foundation models (Meta RoboLlama, Google RT-X) | -50-70% development cost |
| Humanoid robots | $6-20K (was $50-250K in 2023) |
| Autonomous mining | TRL 8-9, ready infrastructure |

**2026 References:**

- Boston Dynamics Atlas 3.0 + DeepMind: 30,000 units/year serial production
- Caterpillar: 690 autonomous trucks, target 2000+ by 2030
- Rio Tinto: 130 trucks + 1700 km autonomous rail (AutoHaul)
- Tesla Optimus Gen 3: $15-20K at mass production
- Unitree R1: **$5,900** per humanoid (July 2025), UBTECH Walker S2: 500+ unit series
- BYD: 1,500 humanoids in 2025, target 20,000 by 2026
- Baidu Apollo: L4 robotaxi in 10+ cities in China

**Conclusion:** AI budget of $15-30 billion is adequate or overestimated thanks to foundation models.

### Dependence on Super-Heavy Rockets

Baseline scenario: $2,500/kg with Starship/Long March 9 availability by 2030.

| Scenario | Cost | Impact |
|----------|------|--------|
| Rockets on time | $2,500/kg | - |
| 2-3 year delay | $3,500/kg | **+$30-50 billion** |

---

### Mission Insurance

| Estimate | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| Baseline | $2-4 billion |
| Realistic (5-10% of cargo) | **$10-20 billion** |

---

### Testing Underestimated

| Stage | Baseline | Realistic | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Factory prototypes | 3-5 iterations | 5-10 iterations | 3-5 ground (Gansu) + 2-5 lunar |
| Robot prototypes | $2 billion | $5-10 billion | Hundreds of versions, thousands of units |
| Lunar testbed | 2 years | 1.5-2.5 years | 3-5 iterations × 3-5 months + deployment |

#### Estimation Methodology {#testing-estimation-methodology}

**Lunar iteration cycle** (with dedicated launches, independent of third-party launch windows):

| Cycle stage | Optimistic | Realistic |
|-------------|------------|-----------|
| Failure analysis (telemetry) | 1-2 weeks | 2-4 weeks |
| Fix design | 2-4 weeks | 4-8 weeks |
| Component manufacturing | 2-4 weeks | 4-8 weeks |
| Prep + flight (3 days) | 1-2 weeks | 2-4 weeks |
| Installation + retest | 1-2 weeks | 2-4 weeks |
| **Total cycle** | **~2 months** | **~4 months** |

**Total testbed:** 3-5 iterations × 3-5 months + 3-6 months deployment = **12-31 months ≈ 1.5-2.5 years**

**Why 5-10 factory iterations, not 10-20:**

- Ground test site (Gansu) — vacuum chambers, thermal simulators (-180°C to +430°C) — allows 3-5 iterations before going to the Moon (TRL 4→6)
- The Moon validates in the real environment (TRL 6→7-8): 2-5 iterations
- Reference: JPL Mars Rover — 7+ Rocky prototypes before Sojourner, but without a ground facility simulating target conditions

**Why 1.5-2.5 years on the Moon, not 3-5 years:**

- Earth-Moon transit: ~3 days (not months like deep space)
- Dedicated launches: independent of third-party windows (cf. NASA CLPS: ~2 flights/year)
- Ground R&D (years 3-4) reduces the number of lunar iterations — a proven system goes to the Moon
