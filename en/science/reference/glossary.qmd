## A

### Aluminothermy
Method of silicon reduction with aluminum instead of carbon. Used on Mercury where carbon is almost absent.

```
3SiO₂ + 4Al → 3Si + 2Al₂O₃
```

**See:** [Technologies and Sources](technology-readiness.qmd)

---

## B

### Bootstrap
First factory assembly on Mercury from 100% imported materials by Gen-1 robots. A unique project phase: before self-replication starts, everything depends on delivered equipment.

**Key:** Critical checkpoint — energy autonomy within 12-24 hours. After checkpoint, assembly time is not critical.

**See:** [First Factory Assembly](../detailed/bootstrap.qmd) | **See also:** [Ground Zero Factory](#ground-zero-factory) — the factory itself

---

## C

### Checkpoint
The moment of energy autonomy during first factory assembly. Charging infrastructure (cables + charging stations) is deployed, robots can work 24/7 with recharging. Must be achieved within 12-24 hours.

**Key:** After checkpoint, total factory assembly time is not critical — even 30 days is fine.

**See:** [First Factory Assembly](../detailed/bootstrap.qmd)

### Cryogenic Cable
Aluminum cable cooled to -180°C in Mercury's permanent shadow for GW-scale power transmission. Replaces copper cables (no copper on Mercury). At cryogenic temperatures, Al resistance drops ~20×.

**TRL:** 4-5 (NIST physics proven, analogs — CERN LHC cryogenics).

**See:** [Technologies and Sources](technology-readiness.qmd#cryogenic-aluminum-gw-cable)

---

## D

### Dark Factories (Lights-off Manufacturing)
Fully automated factories operating 24/7 without human presence. Industry standard: FANUC (Japan), Xiaomi (China).

**TRL:** 9. **Application:** foundation of Mercury production model.

**See:** [Technologies and Sources](technology-readiness.qmd#dark-factories-lights-off-manufacturing)

### Distillation (Slag Processing)
Method of processing MRE electrolysis byproducts. Slag contains useful metal oxides extracted via thermal distillation at different boiling points.

**See:** [Distillation](../detailed/materials/distillation.qmd)

### Dyson Swarm
A cloud of ~1.1 billion independent mirror satellites orbiting a star. NOT a solid sphere (that's a "Dyson Sphere" — science fiction), but a swarm of autonomous elements on heliocentric orbits.

**See:** [Project in 5 Minutes](../executive-summary.qmd)

---

## E

### Electrochromics
Material that changes reflectivity when voltage is applied (like old LCD watches). Used to control mirror orientation without engines — differential reflectivity creates light pressure imbalance.

**TRL:** 6-7 (TiO₂).

**See:** [Technologies and Sources](technology-readiness.qmd#electrochromics-tio₂)

---

## F

### F-M / F-R (Factory Types)
Two factory types on Mercury:

- **F-M (Factory-Mirror)** — produces aluminum mirrors for the Swarm. ~400 mirrors/day. Total ~1,500.
- **F-R (Factory-Replicator)** — produces robots, domes, equipment, new factories. Total ~150.

**See:** [Production](../summaries/production.qmd)

---

## G

### GaAs Panels (Gallium Arsenide)
High-efficiency solar panels (30%+ efficiency) for the initial bootstrap phase. Imported from Earth, providing 168 MW for the first factory before Swarm energy arrives.

**Classes:** Crab-M, Centaur-M, Mole-M

**See:** [Robot Bestiary](../detailed/robots/overview.qmd)

### Ground Zero Factory
First factory on Mercury. 100% of components delivered from Earth. Task — launch self-replication and build subsequent factories from local resources.

**Power consumption:** 55 MW.

**See:** [Ground Zero Factory](../detailed/factories/overview.qmd) | **See also:** [Bootstrap](#bootstrap) — the assembly process

Orbit around the Sun (not around a planet). Swarm mirrors are on heliocentric orbits at ~57.9 million km from the Sun.

---

## I

### ISRU (In-Situ Resource Utilization)

**See:** [Production](../summaries/production.qmd)

## L

### LSP Station (Lunar Solar Power)
Ground-based solar power station on the Moon's surface. Receives concentrated light from the Swarm, converts to 2.45 GHz microwaves, and transmits to rectenna on Earth. Network of 20-40 stations on lunar limbs.

**Advantage:** Heat dissipates into the ground (no space radiators needed), 18% efficiency.

**See:** [LSP Stations](../detailed/hub.qmd)

---

## M

### Mass Driver
Electromagnetic catapult for launching cargo into space. Mercury has no atmosphere → no air resistance → can accelerate to orbital velocity on the surface.

**See:** [Mass Driver Theory](../detailed/railguns/overview.qmd)

### MNLZ (Continuous Casting)

**See:** [Casting](../detailed/factories/elements/casting.qmd)

### MRE (Molten Regolith Electrolysis)
Electrolysis of molten regolith — method for extracting metals and oxygen from lunar/Mercury soil. Regolith melts at ~1600°C, electric current separates oxides into metal (cathode) and oxygen (anode).

**TRL:** 5-6 (NASA, Blue Origin).

**See:** [MRE Electrolysis](../detailed/materials/mre.qmd)
