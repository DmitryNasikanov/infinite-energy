## D

### Dyson Swarm
A cloud of ~1.1 billion independent mirror satellites orbiting a star. NOT a solid sphere (that's a "Dyson Sphere" — science fiction), but a swarm of autonomous elements on heliocentric orbits.

**See:** [Project in 5 Minutes](../executive-summary.qmd)

---

## S

### Swarm Mirrors
Ultra-light reflective disks 100×100 m made of aluminum foil (4 µm). Controlled by light pressure through electrochromic coating. Mass ~116 kg, power on Earth ~19 MW (at 18% efficiency).

**Reference:** IKAROS (JAXA, 2010) — first interplanetary solar sail.

**See:** [Project in 5 Minutes](../executive-summary.qmd), [Swarm Mirrors](../detailed/mirrors.qmd)

---

## P

### Power Beam
Energy transmission system from Swarm to Earth through 3 cascades:

1. **Collection:** Swarm organized into [local clusters](../detailed/mirrors.qmd#mirror-clusters), concentrates light
2. **Transit:** Light travels through vacuum to Hub Station at L1 point
3. **Descent:** Hub converts to laser and redirects to ground receiver

**Efficiency:** 18% ([calculation](../summaries/moon.qmd#energy-transmission-efficiency)), compensated by 100× redundancy.

**See:** [Project in 5 Minutes](../executive-summary.qmd)

---

## E

### Electrochromics
Material that changes reflectivity when voltage is applied (like old LCD watches). Used to control mirror orientation without engines.

---

## M

### Mass Driver
Electromagnetic catapult for launching cargo into space. Mercury has no atmosphere → no air resistance → can accelerate to orbital velocity on the surface.

**Parameters:** length 2–3 km, velocity 5 km/s, installation mass ~1,300 t.

**See:** [Project in 5 Minutes](../executive-summary.qmd), [Railgun Calculations](../detailed/production/railguns/theory.qmd)

---

## V

### "Vitamins"
Critical components that cannot be manufactured on Mercury and must be shipped from Earth:

- Electronics (CPU, sensors)
- Rare earth elements
- High-precision optics
- Some lubricants and dopants

**Share:** 1–3% of robot mass.

**See:** [Project in 5 Minutes](../executive-summary.qmd)

---

## G

### Generation 1 (Gen-1)
Earth-manufactured robots, optimized for mass during delivery. Materials: titanium, carbon fiber, kevlar. High-tech, expensive, limited lifespan.

**Classes:** Spider-E, Crab-E, Centaur-E, Manipulator F-A1, Mole-E

**See:** [Robot Bestiary](../detailed/production/robots/overview.qmd)

### Generation 2 (Gen-2)
Mercury-manufactured robots, optimized for local resources. Materials: steel, aluminum, iron. Heavier, rougher, but cheaper and more repairable.

**Classes:** Crab-M, Centaur-M, Mole-M

**See:** [Robot Bestiary](../detailed/production/robots/overview.qmd)

---

## Ground Zero Factory
First factory on Mercury. 100% of components delivered from Earth. Task — launch self-replication and build subsequent factories from local resources.

**Power consumption:** 55 MW.

**See:** [Ground Zero Factory](../detailed/production/factories/overview.qmd)

---

## Self-Replication
System's ability to build its own copies. Gen-2 robots build Gen-2 robots, factories build factories. Exponential growth.

**Limitation:** Requires "Vitamins" from Earth (1–3% of mass).

### Solar Constant
Solar radiation power per unit area:

- Earth: 1,361 W/m²
- Mercury (orbit average): 10,343 W/m² (7.6× more)

---

## N

### NaS Battery (Sodium-Sulfur)
Battery for [Gen-2 robots](../detailed/production/robots/overview.qmd). Sodium and sulfur are extracted from Mercury regolith. Operating temperature +300°C.

**Advantage:** Does not require lithium (which is absent on Mercury).

**Problem:** Requires constant heating → [solution via cables and stations](risks.qmd#nas-battery-lifetime-during-night).

---

## Phased Array
Array of emitters working synchronously as one antenna. The mirror swarm forms a virtual antenna ~100 km in diameter for energy transmission.

---

## Heliocentric Orbit
Orbit around the Sun (not around a planet). Swarm mirrors are on heliocentric orbits at ~57.9 million km from the Sun.

---

## A

### Aluminothermy
Method of silicon reduction with aluminum instead of carbon. Used on Mercury where carbon is almost absent.

```
3SiO₂ + 4Al → 3Si + 2Al₂O₃
```

---

## H

### Hub Station
Orbital station at L1 point (Earth-Moon), receiving light from the Dyson Swarm and converting it into a laser beam for transmission to Earth.

**Parameters:**

| Characteristic | Value |
|----------------|-------|
| Diameter | 5-10 km |
| Mass | 1-2 million tons |
| Orbit | L1 (326,000 km from Earth) |

**Construction:** Modules are manufactured on the Moon and launched by lunar mass driver to L1 point.

**See:** [Budget](../summaries/budget.qmd#orbital-infrastructure)

---

## L

### L1 Point (Lagrange)
Gravitational equilibrium point between Earth and Moon, approximately 326,000 km from Earth (58,000 km from Moon). An object at L1 maintains position relative to both bodies with minimal correction (~50 m/s per year).

**Application in project:** Hub Station placement. L1 is closer to Moon than GEO (geostationary orbit), which reduces the cost of material delivery by lunar mass driver.

**See:** [Lunar Mass Driver](../detailed/production/railguns/theory.qmd#lunar-mass-driver)

### Lunar Mass Driver
Adaptation of Mercury mass driver for the Moon. Launches Hub Station modules to L1 point.

**Advantages over Mercury:**
- Track length: 1-1.5 km (vs 2-3 km)
- Energy: 3-4 GJ/t (vs 12.5 GJ/t)
- 2× shorter and 3× more economical

**See:** [Calculations](../detailed/production/railguns/theory.qmd#lunar-mass-driver)
