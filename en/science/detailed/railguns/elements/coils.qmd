## Overview

Mass Driver coils are electromagnets that create the magnetic field for projectile acceleration. Coils are sequentially energized, attracting the projectile and accelerating it to 5 km/s.

## Coil Design

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Coils per track | 1,000 (1 per meter) |
| Turns per coil | 50-100 |
| Wire | Aluminum, 10 mm diameter |
| Mass per coil | ~100 kg |
| **TOTAL winding mass** | **~100 t Al** |

## Cryogenic Aluminum

**Problem:** Mercury has no copper (the standard winding material on Earth).

**Solution:** Aluminum at -180°C has conductivity nearly equal to copper at room temperature.

### Conductivity Comparison

| Material | +20°C | -180°C | Increase |
|----------|-------|--------|----------|
| Copper | 100% | 400% | 4x |
| Aluminum | 60% | **360%** | **6x** |

**Conclusion:** Cryo-aluminum is an ideal copper replacement for Mass Drivers.

### Mass Driver Location

Mass Drivers are positioned at the **terminator** (day/night boundary):
- Working section in shadow (temperature -180°C)
- Cooling radiators face the shadow
- Electronics and control on the sunlit side (power source)

## Coil Production

### Winding Process

| Stage | Equipment | Output |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Wire production | Drawing mill | Al, 10 mm diameter |
| Coil winding | Winding machine | 50-100 turns |
| Cooling installation | NaK tube welding | Cooling channels |
| Insulation | Ceramic coating | Arc protection |
| Testing | Ohmmeter | Resistance <0.1 Ohm |

**Productivity:** 1 winding machine = 10-20 coils/day

**For 1,000 coils:** 50-100 days on 1 machine

**With 5 machines:** ~**3 weeks**

**Details:** [Rolling Mill](../../factories/elements/rolling.qmd)

## Coil Cooling System

### NaK Circuit

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Coolant | NaK (eutectic Na-K alloy) |
| Circuit temperature | -150°C |
| NaK flow rate | 100 L/min per track |
| Tube diameter | 20 mm |
| NaK mass in system | ~5 t |

### Radiators

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Radiator area | 5,000 m² |
| Material | Aluminum (thermal conductivity) |
| Location | Facing shadow (-180°C) |
| Heat rejection | ~40 MW |

**Principle:** NaK circulates through coils (absorbs heat) → radiators in shadow (releases heat) → back to coils.

## Heat Generation During Launch

### Energy Balance per Shot

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Energy per launch | 4.7 GJ (including capacitor losses) |
| Efficiency | 40% |
| Heat loss | **2.8 GJ** |
| Shot duration | 0.4 sec |
| Peak heat generation | **~280 MW** (absorbed by thermal mass) |

### Average Power

At 600 launches/day:

```
2.8 GJ × 600 / 86,400 sec = ~20 MW average heat generation
```

**Required rejection:** ~20 MW continuous. Peak heat (280 MW for 0.4 sec) is absorbed by thermal mass of coils and NaK coolant, then dissipated over 2-3 minutes between shots.

## Coil Wear

### Wear Causes

| Cause | Contribution | Consequences |
|-------|--------------|--------------|
| Overheating | 40% | Insulation degradation |
| Electric arcing | 30% | Turn melting |
| Mechanical vibration | 20% | Wire breakage |
| Oxidation | 10% | Corrosion |

### Service Life

| Mode | Launches | Service Life |
|------|----------|--------------|
| Intensive (600/day) | ~500,000 | **3-5 years** |
| Medium (300/day) | ~500,000 | **5-7 years** |

**Replacement:** ~30 t Al/year per Mass Driver.

## Material Balance

**Per 1 Mass Driver (new):**

| Component | Mass | Production |
|-----------|------|------------|
| Windings (1,000 coils) | 100 t Al | 42 t/day → **2.5 days** |
| NaK cooling system | 5 t NaK | Local |
| Radiators | 50 t Al | 42 t/day → **1.5 days** |

**Replacement (wear, 1 Mass Driver over 5 years):**

| Component | Mass/year | Production |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Windings | 30 t Al | 0.7 days production |
| NaK | 1 t | Top-up |

| Coil frame installation | 3 days | 20 Centaur-M |
| Coil mounting (1,000 units) | **2 weeks** | 10 Centaur-M |
