## Overview

The tunnel frame is a load-bearing structure that supports the rails, coils, and electronics of the Mass Driver. The frame must withstand enormous loads during acceleration (1275g).

## Frame Design (Base 1 km)

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Length | **1 km** (base)* |
| Width | 5 m |
| Height | 4 m |
| Material | Fe-6%Mn steel |
| Structure type | Truss frame |

*Optional: 2 km or 3 km.

**Frame mass:** ~270 t (1 km), ~535 t (2 km), ~800 t (3 km).

**Advantages of truss construction:**
- Lightweight (minimal material)
- Strong (load distribution)
- Thermally stable (no deformation at -180C)

## Material: Fe-6%Mn Steel

**Why manganese steel?**

| Property | Fe-6%Mn | Regular steel |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| Strength at -180C | High | Brittle |
| Impact toughness | Retained | Decreases |
| Cost | Local production | Local |

**Details:** [Iron Production](../../materials/mre.qmd)

## Frame Manufacturing

### Production Process

| Stage | Equipment | Output |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Melting Fe + 6% Mn | MRE + distillation | Steel melt |
| Casting billets | CCM-Fe | 100x100 mm billets |
| Rolling to profile | Rolling mill | I-beam, channel |
| Cutting to pieces | Gas cutting | 6-12 m beams |
| Welding trusses | WAAM + robots | 12 m trusses |
| Anti-corrosion coating | Al spraying | Protection |

**Details:** [Rolling Mill](../../factories/elements/rolling.qmd), [WAAM](../../factories/elements/waam.qmd)

---

## Material Balance

**Per 1 Mass Driver (800 t frame):**

| Component | Mass | Production |
|-----------|------|------------|
| Fe-6%Mn steel (main beams) | 700 t | 18 t/day -> **39 days** |
| Fasteners, bolts | 50 t | 18 t/day -> **3 days** |
| Anti-corrosion coating (Al) | 50 t | 42 t/day -> **1.5 days** |

**TOTAL:** ~**40-45 days** for material production.

---

## Support Types

### Concrete Supports (on ground)

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Number of supports | 300 (every 10 m) |
| Mass per support | ~1 t concrete |
| Foundation depth | 2-3 m into regolith |
| **TOTAL concrete** | **~300 t** |

**Concrete on Mercury:**
- Raw materials: regolith + water (from polar craters)
- Binder: sulfide cement (from sulfur)
- Strength: sufficient for supports

### Anchor Bolts

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Bolts per support | 4 pcs |
| Diameter | 20 mm |
| Length | 1 m |
| **TOTAL bolts** | **1200 pcs** |

---

## Frame Assembly

### Sequence

| Stage | Time | Robots |
|-------|------|--------|
| Trench excavation (3 km) | **3 months** | 50 Moles |
| Installing concrete supports | 2 weeks | 20 Centaurs |
| Truss mounting (250 sections) | **1 month** | 30 Centaurs |
| Joint welding | 1 week | 10 Centaurs |
| Geometry calibration | 3 days | Automated |

**TOTAL:** ~**4.5 months** from start to completed frame.

## Frame Loads

### Static Loads

| Component | Mass | Load on frame |
|-----------|------|---------------|
| Rails (2 pcs) | 210 t | 0.07 t/m |
| Coils (3000 pcs) | 300 t | 0.1 t/m |
| Electronics | 7 t | 0.002 t/m |
| **TOTAL** | **517 t** | **~0.17 t/m** |

### Dynamic Loads

| Source | Force | Time |
|--------|-------|------|
| Projectile acceleration (1275g) | **1.44 MN per carriage** | 0.4 sec |
| Magnetic field | ~10 kN per coil | Impulse |
| Vibrations | ~5 kN | Continuous |

**Safety factor:** frame designed for 3x loads. High acceleration (1275g) is compensated by short duration (0.4 sec).

## Thermal Stability

### Temperature Regimes

| Zone | Temperature | Steel expansion |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| Shadow (main section) | -180C | Contraction -0.3% |
| Terminator (transition) | 0C | Neutral |
| Sunlit (electronics) | +50C | Expansion +0.1% |

**Compensation:**
- Thermal joints every 100 m
- Sliding supports (allow expansion)
- Pre-tension (compensates contraction)

---

## Wear and Maintenance

### Wearing Parts

| Component | Service life | Replacement |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Fastening bolts | 5-10 years | On schedule |
| Weld seams | 10-20 years | Ultrasonic testing |
| Anti-corrosion coating | 3-5 years | Re-spraying |

**Maintenance:**
- Monthly inspection (Centaurs + cameras)
- Annual geometry calibration (laser measurements)
- Replacement of worn elements as needed

---

## Quality Control

| Parameter | Control | Standard | Action on deviation |
|-----------|---------|----------|---------------------|
| Straightness | Laser sensor (import, vitamin) | +/-5 mm per 100 m | Support adjustment |
| Perpendicularity | Laser sensor | +/-0.1 deg | Correction |
| Weld seams | Visual (cameras) + load test | No visible defects | Re-welding |
| Bolted connections | Torque wrench (local production) | Torque 300 Nm | Retightening |
