4. Geometry check (laser scanner)

---

## Stage 2: Chassis Mounting (6 Wheels)

**Process:**
1. Side panel installation (bolts + rivets)
2. Radiator mounting on roof
3. Joint sealing (regolith dust protection)

---

## Stage 4: Bucket and Hydraulics Mounting

**Bucket:**
- Volume: 1 m³
- Mass: 200 kg (steel Fe-6%Mn)
- Load capacity: 2.5 t regolith
- Design: Reinforced edges for digging

**Bucket hydraulics:**
- 4 hydraulic cylinders (NaK)
- Force: 50 kN per cylinder = 200 kN total

---

## Stage 5: Actuator Mounting

**10 actuators:**
- 6 wheel drives (electric, 5 kW each + cycloidal gearbox 1:20)
- 4 bucket hydraulic cylinders (50 kN each)

**Process:**
1. Connect wheel motors to power bus
2. Power cable routing to transformer
3. Bucket hydraulic cylinder mounting
4. NaK hydraulic circuit fill

**Details:** [Actuators](../elements/actuators.qmd)

---

## Stage 6: 10 kV Power Cable Routing

**10 kV cable (MI type):**
- Length: 50 m (cable reel)
- Cross-section: 50 mm² Al
- Insulation: MgO (mineral, all materials local)
- Voltage: 10 kV (stepped down to 400 V by transformer)
- Current: 3 A (at 30 kW load)

> **Why 50 mm² at only 3 A?** The cross-section is determined by mechanical strength, not electrical requirements. A 50 m cable on a reel experiences repeated bending during winding/unwinding, abrasive wear from regolith contact, and tensile loads during dragging. Minimum cross-section for mechanical strength is ~35 mm²; 50 mm² selected with margin.

**Cable reel:**
- Automatic winding during movement
- Capacity: 50 m (Mole-M operating radius from source)

**Process:**
1. Cable reel installation on housing
2. 10 kV → 400 V transformer mounting

**Process:**
1. Mole-M digs regolith (1 m³ bucket)
2. Dumps into Crab-M bed
3. Crab-M transports regolith to factory (5 t per trip)
4. Cycle repeats
