## Overview

Self-replication is a factory's ability to produce copies of itself. This is the key technology for achieving exponential growth of production capacity on Mercury.

---

## Energy [Bootstrap](../../../reference/glossary.qmd#bootstrap-blitz-assembly) (Phase 0)

**Problem:** How to start production without energy from the Dyson Swarm?

**Solution:** CPV system (~10.5 t: Kapton+Al concentrators + GaAs cells) provides **168 MW** — a **113 MW** surplus above the first factory's consumption (55 MW).

### Energy Reserve Calculation

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| 1 factory consumption | 55 MW |
| Available (CPV system ~10.5 t) | 168 MW |
| **Reserve** | **113 MW** |
| Supports | 2-3 additional factories |

**Conclusion:** The factory is energy-independent from day one. No need to wait for the Dyson Swarm to begin replication.

**Details:** [Production](../../../summaries/production.qmd#energy)

## Phase 0: First Mass Driver (Month 0-1)

Before factory replication, we need to build the first Mass Driver for launching mirrors.

### First Mass Driver Timeline (1 km baseline)

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Mass Driver mass | **500 tons*** |
| Al production | 42 t/day |
| Fe production | 18 t/day** |
| Time for Al (~220 t) | **5 days** |
| Time for Fe (~270 t) | **15 days** |
| Assembly and testing | 5-7 days |
| **TOTAL first Mass Driver (1 km)** | **~25 days** |

*Baseline 1 km variant. For extended 2-3 km tracks: mass 875-1,300 t, time 40-60 days.

**Peak mode. Nominal Fe production is 11 t/day; peak for Mass Driver construction is 18 t/day via parallel melting.

**Details:** [Mass Driver Production](../../railguns/overview.qmd)

---

### Mini-Swarm for Mercury Energy

After launching the first Mass Driver, we build a minimal set of mirrors to power new factories.

| Parameter | Calculation |
|-----------|-------------|
| 1 mirror intercepts | 103 MW |
| After reflection (90%) and losses (15%) | ~80 MW at receiver |
| GaAs panels (30%) | **~24 MW electricity** |
| Efficiency (mirror → electricity) | **~23%** |
| Needed for 10 factories (550 MW) | 550 ÷ 24 = **23 mirrors** |
| With 10x margin | **~230 mirrors** |

**Producing 230 mirrors:** The first Ground Zero Factory can produce mirrors on the rolling mill (foil) with manual assembly. At ~392 mirrors/day — **less than 1 day**.

**Logic:** 230 mirrors power 10 factories with 10x margin. This is sufficient to start Phase 1.

---

## Phase 1: Exponential Factory Growth (Months 2-6)

[Replicator factories (Ground Zero Factory)](../overview.qmd#ground-zero-factory) build new factories. First — new Ground Zero Factories (for exponential growth), then — [mirror factories](../overview.qmd#mirror-factory) (for mirror production). At 100% Ground Zero Factory allocation to replication:

### Replication Timeline (theoretical)

| Week | Factories | Note |
|------|-----------|------|
| 0 | 1 | Bootstrap |
| 3 | 2 | Doubling |
| 6 | 4 | |
| 9 | 8 | |
| 12 | 16 | |
| 15 | 32 | |
| 21 | 128 | |
| 30 | ~1,000 | ~7.5 months |

**Doubling time:** ~3 weeks (at 100% allocation to replication)

> **Important:** This is the theoretical rate with all materials available. Practically, growth from 1 → 1,000 takes **~4 years** due to the bottleneck — ["Vitamins"](../../../reference/glossary.qmd#vitamins) delivery from Earth.

**Details:** [Production Scaling](../../railguns/overview.qmd)

### What Does a Ground Zero Factory Produce for a New Factory?

| Component | Mass | Time | Details |
|-----------|------|------|---------|
| Dome (8 t) | 8 t | 2-3 days | [Dome Assembly](domes.qmd) |
| Equipment (51 t) | 51 t | 10-15 days | [Equipment Production](equipment.qmd) |
| Robots (15 units x 960 kg) | 14 t | 3 days | [Robot Production](../../robots/overview.qmd) |
| Energy system (panels) | 10 t | 5 days | [Production](../../../summaries/production.qmd#energy) |
| **TOTAL** | **~83 t** | **~3 weeks** | |

> **Parallel Work:** Critical path is equipment (10-15 days). Dome, robots, and energy system are produced in parallel, so total time = equipment time + final assembly (3-5 days) ≈ **~3 weeks**.

**Growth Strategy:**

1. **Exponential growth phase:** All Ground Zero Factories at 100% build new Ground Zero Factories (doubling every 3 weeks)
2. **Switch to mirror factories:** After reaching target Ground Zero Factory count (~100 units) — transition to building mirror factories
3. **Mirror factories are simpler:** No WAAM/CNC, cutting table, or assembly jigs needed → equipment kit is lighter and faster to manufacture

---

## Phase 2: Infrastructure Deployment (Months 6-7)

After reaching 1,000 factories, focus shifts to building Mass Drivers.

### Timeline for 1,000 Mass Drivers (1 km baseline)

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Factories | 1,000 |
| Al production | 42 t/day x 1,000 = 42,000 t/day |
| Fe production | 11 t/day x 1,000 = 11,000 t/day |
| Mass of 1 Mass Driver (1 km) | **500 t** (220 t Al + 270 t Fe) |
| Materials for 1,000 Mass Drivers | 500,000 t |
| Time for 1,000 Mass Drivers | **~15 days** |

**Conclusion:** 1,000 factories build 1,000 Mass Drivers in **~2 weeks** (1 km baseline track).

*For 3 km tracks: mass 1,300 t, time ~30 days.

**Details:** [Mass Driver Production](../../railguns/overview.qmd)

---

### Robot Deployment

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Factories | 1,000 |
| Robots per factory | 60 (20 Moles, 20 Crabs, 20 Centaurs) |
| **TOTAL robots** | **60,000** |
| Robot production | 5 robots/day x 1,000 factories = 5,000 robots/day |
| Time for 60,000 robots | **~12 days** |

---

## Phase 3: Mirror Production (Months 7-114)

After infrastructure deployment, all 1,000 factories switch to mirror production.

### Timeline for 1 Billion Mirrors

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Factories | 1,000 |
| Mirrors/day per factory | ~350 |
| **TOTAL mirrors/day** | **~350,000** |
| Target | 1 billion mirrors |
| Time | **~2,860 days (~8 years)** |

**Details:** [Dyson Swarm Mirrors](../../../summaries/mirrors.qmd)

|-----|-------|------|
| 1-7 | Factory deployment | Blitz assembly ([Gen-1](../../../reference/glossary.qmd#generation-1-gen-1) robots) |

**Details:** [Roadmap](../../../summaries/roadmap.qmd)

## Bottlenecks and Risks

| Bottleneck | Risk | Solution |
|------------|------|----------|
| Energy for first factories | Energy shortage during replication | Mini-Swarm of 230 mirrors powers 10 factories |
| ["Vitamins"](../../../reference/glossary.qmd#vitamins) import | Electronics, rare metals | Regular runs from Earth (once per 3 months) |
| [Gen-1](../../../reference/glossary.qmd#generation-1-gen-1) robot failures | Fragile titanium robots | Quick transition to [Gen-2](../../../reference/glossary.qmd#generation-2-gen-2) (local Fe/Al) |
| Equipment wear | Continuous caster, rolling mill | Spare parts in first expedition |

---

## Bottleneck: ["Vitamins"](../../../reference/glossary.qmd#vitamins) Delivery

### Theoretical vs Practical Growth Rate

| Parameter | Theoretical | Practical |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Self-replication rate | 1 factory → 2 factories in 3 weeks | Same (local materials) |
| Growth 1 → 1,000 | **~4 months** (exponential) | **~4 years** (delivery-limited) |
| Bottleneck | None (with "Vitamins" available) | **"Vitamins" delivery from Earth** |

### Bottleneck Calculation

**"Vitamins" requirements:**
- Per factory: ~2 t (electronics, Cu, rare earths)
- For 1,000 factories: **2,000 t**

**Delivery constraints:**
- Flight time Earth → Mercury: 3-12 months
- Launch rate: 200-275 launches/year (peak capacity of all spaceports)
- Payload capacity: 30-70 t/launch on Mercury trajectory

**Realistic scenario** (from [delivery.qmd](../../../summaries/delivery.qmd)):
- Year 7: 25 factories (800 t cargo, 16-32 launches)
- Year 8: 120 factories (2,200 t, 44-88 launches)
- Year 9: 500 factories (7,200 t, 144-288 launches)
- Year 10: 1,000 factories (11,600 t, 232-464 launches)

**Conclusion:** Exponential growth 1 → 1,000 in 4 months is TECHNICALLY possible (local materials available), but LOGISTICALLY constrained by "Vitamins" delivery and stretches to ~4 years.

### Optimization Strategies

**Option 1: Pre-staging "Vitamins"**
- Send 3,000 t of "Vitamins" BEFORE growth begins
- Requires ~100 launches in the year before replication starts
- Enables theoretical 4-month pace
- **Problem:** Too large an upfront investment

**Option 2: Parallel Delivery (baseline scenario)**
- Factory growth synchronized with "Vitamins" delivery
- ~4 years from 1 to 1,000 factories
- ~2,400 t total cargo (thanks to 99.998% localization)
- **Advantage:** Investment distributed over time

**Option 3: Hybrid**
- First 100 factories: rapid growth (pre-stage "Vitamins")
- Then: synchronize with delivery
- **Compromise:** 1 → 100 in ~1 year, 100 → 1,000 in 3 years

## Material Balance of Self-Replication

**Material consumption (1 factory over 3 weeks):**

| Material | Consumption | Source |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| Aluminum (Al) | ~50 t | [Regolith Processing](../../materials/overview.qmd) |
| Iron (Fe) | ~30 t | [Regolith Processing](../../materials/overview.qmd) |
| Silicon (Si) | ~10 t | [Regolith Processing](../../materials/overview.qmd) |
| Imports (electronics, Cu) | ~2 t | **Earth** |

**Localization:** ~97% by mass

---

## System Performance

### After Phase 1 (1,000 factories)

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Al production | 42,000 t/day |
| Fe production | ~11,000 t/day |
| Mirror production | ~350,000 units/day |
| Robot production | 5,000 units/day |
| Energy consumption | 55 GW (55 MW × 1,000) |

**Energy supply:** 230 mini-Swarm mirrors cover the first 10 factories. Continuous Swarm expansion is required in parallel with factory growth.

---

## Final Numbers

| Stage | Timeline (practical) | Factories/Mass Drivers/Robots | **MIRRORS** (main goal) |
|-------|----------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Phase 0** | 2 months | 1 factory + 1 Mass Driver | **230 mirrors** (mini-Swarm for energy) |
| **Phase 1** | **~4 years** | 1 → 1,000 factories | **~143M mirrors** (50% capacity on replication, 50% on mirrors) |
| **Phase 2** | 1-2 months | 1,000 Mass Drivers + 60,000 robots | **~25M mirrors** (parallel with Mass Drivers) |
| **Phase 3** | ~7 years | Infrastructure ready | **~832M mirrors** (100% capacity on mirrors) |
| **TOTAL** | **~11 years** | Full infrastructure | **~1 billion mirrors in Dyson Swarm** |

**Key point:** Mirrors are the MAIN GOAL of the project. They are produced **from the very beginning**, not just in Phase 3:
- **Phase 1:** Factories grow AND produce mirrors (50/50 allocation)
- **Phase 2:** Build Mass Drivers AND continue producing mirrors
- **Phase 3:** ALL capacity (100%) on mirror production

**Note:** Phase 1 stretches from 4 months (theoretical) to 4 years (practical) due to the bottleneck — "Vitamins" delivery (electronics, rare materials) from Earth. The self-replication rate (~3 weeks per factory) is limited not by local materials, but by import logistics.

**Phase 1 mirror calculation:**
- Average factories during growth: ~500 (from 1 to 1,000)
- Output: 500 factories × 350 mirrors/day × 50% = ~88,000 mirrors/day
- Over 4 years (1,460 days): ~88,000 × 1,460 = ~128M mirrors (calculated)
- With reserve for defects and losses (+12%): **~143M mirrors**
