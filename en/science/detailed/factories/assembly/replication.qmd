## Overview

Self-replication is a factory's ability to produce copies of itself. This is the key technology for achieving exponential growth of production capacity on Mercury.

---

## Energy Bootstrap (Phase 0)

**Problem:** How to start production without energy from the Dyson Swarm?

**Solution:** 3 cargo runs of GaAs panels provide **168 MW** — a **113 MW** surplus above the first factory's consumption (55 MW).

### Energy Reserve Calculation

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| 1 factory consumption | 55 MW |
| Available (3 GaAs runs) | 168 MW |
| **Reserve** | **113 MW** |
| Supports | 2-3 additional factories |

**Conclusion:** The factory is energy-independent from day one. No need to wait for the Dyson Swarm to begin replication.

## Phase 0: First Mass Driver (Month 0-1)

Before factory replication, we need to build the first Mass Driver for launching mirrors.

### First Mass Driver Timeline (1 km baseline)

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Mass Driver mass | **450 tons*** |
| Al production | 42 t/day |
| Fe production | 18 t/day |
| Time for Al (~170 t) | **4 days** |
| Time for Fe (~270 t) | **15 days** |
| Assembly and testing | 5-7 days |
| **TOTAL first Mass Driver (1 km)** | **~25 days** |

*Baseline 1 km variant. For extended 2-3 km tracks: mass 875-1,300 t, time 40-60 days.

**Details:** [Mass Driver Production](../../railguns/overview.qmd)

---

### Mini-Swarm for Mercury Energy

After launching the first Mass Driver, we build a minimal set of mirrors to power new factories.

| Parameter | Calculation |
|-----------|-------------|
| 1 mirror reflects | 93 MW |
| Needed for 10 factories | 550 MW |
| Energy transmission efficiency | ~10% |
| Required reflected power | 5.5 GW = 60 mirrors |
| With 10x margin | **600 mirrors** |

**Producing 600 mirrors:** The first Ground Zero Factory can produce mirrors on the rolling mill (foil) with manual assembly, though not optimized for this. Estimate: ~50 mirrors/day → **~12 days** for 600 units.

**Logic:** 600 mirrors power 10 factories. This is sufficient for Phase 1 (growth to 1,000 factories over 4 months).

---

## Phase 1: Exponential Factory Growth (Months 2-6)

[Replicator factories (Ground Zero Factory)](../overview.qmd#ground-zero-factory) build new factories. First — new Ground Zero Factories (for exponential growth), then — [mirror factories](../overview.qmd#mirror-factory) (for mirror production). At 100% Ground Zero Factory allocation to replication:

### Replication Timeline

| Week | Factories | Growth |
|------|-----------|--------|
| 0 | 1 | — |
| 6 | 2 | +1 |
| 9 | 4 | +2 |
| 12 | 16 | +12 |
| 16 | ~1,000 | +984 |

**Doubling time:** ~3 weeks (at 50% allocation to replication)

**Details:** [Production Scaling](../../railguns/scaling.qmd)

### What Does a Ground Zero Factory Produce for a New Factory?

| Component | Mass | Time | Details |
|-----------|------|------|---------|
| Dome (8 t) | 8 t | 2-3 days | [Dome Assembly](domes.qmd) |
| Equipment (51 t) | 51 t | 10-15 days | [Equipment Production](equipment.qmd) |
| Robots (15 units x 960 kg) | 14 t | 3 days | [Robot Production](../../robots/overview.qmd) |
| Energy system (panels) | 10 t | 5 days | [Production](../../../summaries/production.qmd#energy) |
| **TOTAL** | **~83 t** | **~3 weeks** | |

**Growth Strategy:**

1. **Exponential growth phase:** All Ground Zero Factories at 100% build new Ground Zero Factories (doubling every 3 weeks)
2. **Switch to mirror factories:** After reaching target Ground Zero Factory count (~100 units) — transition to building mirror factories
3. **Mirror factories are simpler:** No WAAM/CNC, cutting table, or assembly jigs needed → equipment kit is lighter and faster to manufacture

---

## Phase 2: Infrastructure Deployment (Months 6-7)

After reaching 1,000 factories, focus shifts to building Mass Drivers.

### Timeline for 1,000 Mass Drivers (1 km baseline)

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Factories | 1,000 |
| Al production | 42 t/day x 1,000 = 42,000 t/day |
| Fe production | 18 t/day x 1,000 = 18,000 t/day |
| Mass of 1 Mass Driver (1 km) | **450 t** (170 t Al + 270 t Fe) |
| Materials for 1,000 Mass Drivers | 450,000 t |
| Time for 1,000 Mass Drivers | **~15 days** |

**Conclusion:** 1,000 factories build 1,000 Mass Drivers in **~2 weeks** (1 km baseline track).

*For 3 km tracks: mass 1,300 t, time ~30 days.

**Details:** [Mass Driver Production](../../railguns/overview.qmd)

---

### Robot Deployment

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Factories | 1,000 |
| Robots per factory | 60 (20 Moles, 20 Crabs, 20 Centaurs) |
| **TOTAL robots** | **60,000** |
| Robot production | 5 robots/day x 1,000 factories = 5,000 robots/day |
| Time for 60,000 robots | **~12 days** |

---

## Phase 3: Mirror Production (Months 7-114)

After infrastructure deployment, all 1,000 factories switch to mirror production.

### Timeline for 1 Billion Mirrors

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Factories | 1,000 |
| Mirrors/day per factory | ~392 |
| **TOTAL mirrors/day** | **~392,000** |
| Target | 1 billion mirrors |
| Time | **~2,555 days (~7 years)** |

**Details:** [Dyson Swarm Mirrors](../../../summaries/mirrors.qmd)

## Bottlenecks and Risks

| Bottleneck | Risk | Solution |
|------------|------|----------|
| Energy for first factories | Energy shortage during replication | Mini-Swarm of 600 mirrors powers 10 factories |
| "Vitamins" import | Electronics, rare metals | Regular runs from Earth (once per 3 months) |
| Gen-1 robot failures | Fragile titanium robots | Quick transition to Gen-2 (local Fe/Al) |
| Equipment wear | Continuous caster, rolling mill | Spare parts in first expedition |

---

## Bottleneck: "Vitamins" Delivery

### Theoretical vs Practical Growth Rate

| Parameter | Theoretical | Practical |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Self-replication rate | 1 factory → 2 factories in 3 weeks | Same (local materials) |
| Growth 1 → 1,000 | **~4 months** (exponential) | **~4 years** (delivery-limited) |
| Bottleneck | None (with "Vitamins" available) | **"Vitamins" delivery from Earth** |

### Bottleneck Calculation

**"Vitamins" requirements:**
- Per factory: ~2 t (electronics, Cu, rare earths)
- For 1,000 factories: **2,000 t**

**Delivery constraints:**
- Flight time Earth → Mercury: 3-12 months
- Launch rate: 200-275 launches/year (peak capacity of all spaceports)
- Payload capacity: 30-70 t/launch on Mercury trajectory

**Realistic scenario** (from [delivery.qmd](../../../summaries/delivery.qmd)):
- Year 7: 25 factories (800 t cargo, 16-32 launches)
- Year 8: 120 factories (2,200 t, 44-88 launches)
- Year 9: 500 factories (7,200 t, 144-288 launches)
- Year 10: 1,000 factories (11,600 t, 232-464 launches)

**Conclusion:** Exponential growth 1 → 1,000 in 4 months is TECHNICALLY possible (local materials available), but LOGISTICALLY constrained by "Vitamins" delivery and stretches to ~4 years.

### Optimization Strategies

**Option 1: Pre-staging "Vitamins"**
- Send 3,000 t of "Vitamins" BEFORE growth begins
- Requires ~100 launches in the year before replication starts
- Enables theoretical 4-month pace
- **Problem:** Too large an upfront investment

**Option 2: Parallel Delivery (baseline scenario)**
- Factory growth synchronized with "Vitamins" delivery
- ~4 years from 1 to 1,000 factories
- ~2,400 t total cargo (thanks to 96% localization)
- **Advantage:** Investment distributed over time

**Option 3: Hybrid**
- First 100 factories: rapid growth (pre-stage "Vitamins")
- Then: synchronize with delivery
- **Compromise:** 1 → 100 in ~1 year, 100 → 1,000 in 3 years

## Material Balance of Self-Replication

**Material consumption (1 factory over 3 weeks):**

| Material | Consumption | Source |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| Aluminum (Al) | ~50 t | [Regolith Processing](../../materials/overview.qmd) |
| Iron (Fe) | ~30 t | [Regolith Processing](../../materials/overview.qmd) |
| Silicon (Si) | ~10 t | [Regolith Processing](../../materials/overview.qmd) |
| Imports (electronics, Cu) | ~2 t | **Earth** |

**Localization:** ~97% by mass

---

## System Performance

### After Phase 1 (1,000 factories)

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Al production | 42,000 t/day |
| Fe production | 18,000 t/day |
| Mirror production | ~392,000 units/day |
| Robot production | 5,000 units/day |
| Energy consumption | 55 GW (55 MW x 1,000) |

**Energy supply:** 600 mini-Swarm mirrors are insufficient. Continuous Swarm expansion is required in parallel with factory growth.

---

## Final Numbers

| Stage | Timeline (practical) | Factories/Mass Drivers/Robots | **MIRRORS** (main goal) |
|-------|----------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Phase 0** | 2 months | 1 factory + 1 Mass Driver | **600 mirrors** (energy for growth) |
| **Phase 1** | **~4 years** | 1 → 1,000 factories | **~30M mirrors** (50% capacity on replication, 50% on mirrors) |
| **Phase 2** | 1-2 months | 1,000 Mass Drivers + 60,000 robots | **~25M mirrors** (parallel with Mass Drivers) |
| **Phase 3** | ~7 years | Infrastructure ready | **~945M mirrors** (100% capacity on mirrors) |
| **TOTAL** | **~11 years** | Full infrastructure | **~1 billion mirrors in Dyson Swarm** |

**Key point:** Mirrors are the MAIN GOAL of the project. They are produced **from the very beginning**, not just in Phase 3:
- **Phase 1:** Factories grow AND produce mirrors (50/50 allocation)
- **Phase 2:** Build Mass Drivers AND continue producing mirrors
- **Phase 3:** ALL capacity (100%) on mirror production

**Note:** Phase 1 stretches from 4 months (theoretical) to 4 years (practical) due to the bottleneck — "Vitamins" delivery (electronics, rare materials) from Earth. The self-replication rate (~3 weeks per factory) is limited not by local materials, but by import logistics.

**Phase 1 mirror calculation:**
- Average factories during growth: ~500 (from 1 to 1,000)
- Output: 500 factories x 210 mirrors/day x 50% = ~52,500 mirrors/day
- Over 4 years (1,460 days): ~52,500 x 1,460 = **~76M mirrors** (more precise calculation)
