## Purpose and Calculation Status

The purpose of this documentation is to confirm the **fundamental feasibility** of the project and provide preliminary estimates of budgets and timelines. Calculations confirm: all necessary technologies exist ([MRE](../../reference/technology-readiness.qmd#mre-electrolysis) electrolysis, [WAAM](../../reference/technology-readiness.qmd#waam-3d-printing), solar concentration, electromagnetic launch), materials on Mercury are present in sufficient quantities (Al, Fe, Si, Ti, S), delivery logistics are realistic given current launch cost trends.

All figures provided (areas, capacities, material flows) are **preliminary order-of-magnitude estimates**. Transition to implementation requires work by a professional engineering team to refine parameters, detailed design, and validation of adopted solutions.

## Self-Replication Concept

The "Ground Zero Factory" is the first self-replicating factory on Mercury. Its task is to build new factories from local materials using robots and solar energy.

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Principle | Gravity-flow line + vacuum distillation |
| External environment | Vacuum |
| Internal dome environment | Oxygen 0.1 atm (local, from MRE) |
| **Dome dimensions** | **~50x30 m (~1,500 m^2)** |
| Dome height | 6-8 m (for 1 t bridge crane) |
| Power consumption (factory) | 5 MW (peak) |
| Available energy (3 GaAs shipments) | 168 MW (113 MW reserve) |

**Exponential growth strategy:**

```
Factory #0 (Ground Zero) -> builds Factory #1
Factories #0-1 -> build Factories #2-3
Factories #0-3 -> build Factories #4-7
...
-> 1 factory -> ~1,650 factories in ~4 years (practically, due to "Vitamins" delivery)
```

**First expedition:** ~67 tons from Earth (including 5.25 t GaAs panels), assembly in 7 days.

**More on preparation:** [First Factory Assembly (Bootstrap)](../bootstrap.qmd) | [Roadmap](../../summaries/roadmap.qmd)

## Factory Types

All factories use the **same dome** (50x30 m, 1,500 m^2) but differ in assembly zone specialization. Combining robot, dome, and mirror production in one dome is impossible - insufficient floor space.

### Lean Manufacturing Principle

Inside the dome - only equipment and operational buffer. Material and finished product storage - **outside** on open pads (vacuum, no corrosion). Crab-M robots load/unload through the airlock using JIT (just-in-time) principle.

| Parameter | Inside dome | Outside (vacuum) |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| Purpose | Production | Storage |
| Area | 1,500 m^2 (dome) | ~500 m^2 (pads) |
| Contents | Machines, conveyors, AGV | Racks, containers |
| Buffer | ~50 m^2 (airlock) | Unlimited |

### Factory-Replicator (F-R)

The first factory ("Ground Zero") and ~150 subsequent ones (~10%). Fully self-sufficient for building new factories:

- [Gen-2](../../reference/glossary.qmd#generation-2-gen-2) robots (Mole-M, Crab-M, Centaur-M)
- Domes (cutting, welding, sealing)
- Factory equipment ([CCM](../../reference/glossary.qmd#ccm-continuous-casting), rolling mills, WAAM cells)
- Mass Driver elements (rails, coils, frame)
- **Does NOT produce** mirrors

### Inter-Factory Logistics (Crab-M)

Factory specialization requires transport between them:

| From | To | Cargo | Transport |
|------|----|-------|-----------|
| F-R | New factory site | Dome (8 t, folded) | 4 Crab-M |
| F-R | New factory | Equipment (~51 t) | 6 Crab-M |
| F-R | MD site | Rails, coils, frame | 4 Crab-M |
| F-M | Mass Driver buffer | Mirror containers | 4 Crab-M |
| F-R | All factories | Finished robots | Self-propelled |

**Intra-shop logistics (inside dome):** AGV (automated guided vehicles) + 1 t bridge crane + Centaur-M (manipulators on assembly).

---

## Three Stages of Factory Production

Factory production is divided into three sequential stages:

### 1. Material Processing (Regolith -> Al/Fe/Si)

All regolith processing occurs in the **common material base** of the project.

**Process:**
- Regolith crushing
- Melting in solar furnaces
- MRE electrolysis -> separation into Fe, Al, Si, Ti, S
- Distillation -> aluminum purification
- Material transport to factory dome

**More details:** [Regolith Processing](../materials/overview.qmd)

**Material output (600 t regolith/day):**

| Material | Output | Application |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Aluminum (Al) | 42 t/day | Mirrors, robot casings, conductors |
| Iron (Fe) | 18 t/day | Robot frames, MD rails, dome frame |
| Silicon (Si) | 25 t/day | Solar panels, fiberglass |
| Titanium (Ti) | 3 t/day | Mirror electrochromics |
| Sulfur (S) | 18 t/day | [NaS](../../reference/technology-readiness.qmd#nas-batteries) batteries |

---

### 2. Element Production (Materials -> Parts)

Finished materials (Al/Fe/Si) are transformed into structural elements: sheets, profiles, wire, parts.

#### Material Transport to Dome

Materials enter the factory dome through various transport systems:

| Material | Source | Transport | Destination |
|----------|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Al melt 42 t/day | [Distillation](../materials/distillation.qmd) | MHD inlet 1500C | Aluminum line |
| Fe/Si melt 35 t/day | [MRE electrolysis](../materials/mre.qmd) | MHD inlet 1500C | Iron line |
| TiO2 powder 3 t/day | [Titanium line](../materials/titanium.qmd) | Pneumatic transport | Electrochromics |
| Fiberglass 28 t/day | [Fiberglass line](../materials/silicate-fabric.qmd) | Conveyor (spools) | Composite domes |

#### Element Production Lines

Four production lines operate inside the factory dome:

**More on each line:**

- [Metal melting](elements/melting.qmd) - melt preparation for casting
- [CCM casting](elements/casting.qmd) - continuous casting of billets
- [Rolling mill](elements/rolling.qmd) - rolling sheets, profiles, wire
- [WAAM 3D printing](elements/waam.qmd) - complex part fabrication

**Element output:**

| Element | Material | Capacity | Application |
|---------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Aluminum foil | Al | ~12 t/day | Mirrors |
| Aluminum sheets | Al | ~15 t/day | Casings, domes |
| Aluminum wire | Al | ~10 t/day | WAAM, windings |
| Iron wire | Fe | ~8 t/day | WAAM, cables |
| Iron rolled stock | Fe | ~10 t/day | Frames, rails |

---

### 3. Final Assembly (Elements -> Products)

Elements are assembled into finished products. Product type depends on factory specialization.

#### F-R: Replication (domes + equipment + robots)

- **Domes** - silicate shell for new factories -> [More details](assembly/domes.qmd)
- **Equipment** - CCM, rolling mill, WAAM cells -> [More details](assembly/equipment.qmd)
- **Robots** - Mole-M, Crab-M, Centaur-M -> [More details](../robots/overview.qmd)
- **Self-replication** - new factory construction coordination -> [More details](assembly/replication.qmd)

#### F-M: Mirrors (~400/day)

- **Mirrors** - Z-fold solar reflectors for Mass Driver
