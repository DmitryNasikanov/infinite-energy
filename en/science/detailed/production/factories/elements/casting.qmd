> **TL;DR**
>
> - **Purpose:** Converting molten metal into ingots and billets
> - **Technology:** CCM (Continuous Casting Machine)
> - **Throughput:** 42 t Al + 35 t Fe → billets 100×100 mm
> - **Key feature:** NaK cooling (not water!), copper molds

## Overview

CCM is key equipment for converting liquid metal into solid billets. Melt from the tundish flows continuously into the crystallizer, where it solidifies and is drawn out as an ingot.

## CCM Design

### Crystallizer

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Material | Copper (from Earth) — high thermal conductivity |
| Shape | Square 100×100 mm |
| Length | 800 mm |
| Coating | Nickel (corrosion protection) |
| Cooling | NaK circuit (not water!) |

**Why copper?**
- Thermal conductivity 400 W/(m·K) — approximately 8× faster heat removal than steel
- Does not react with Al and Fe during brief contact
- Durability: 500-1000 heats without replacement

**Why NaK instead of water?**
- Water freezes at −150°C outside the dome
- NaK is liquid from −12°C to +785°C — works in any conditions
- Closed cycle: NaK → radiators → return

---

### Withdrawal Rolls

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Number of pairs | 3-4 |
| Withdrawal speed | 0.5-1 m/min |
| Force per pair | 5-10 tons |
| Roll material | Steel with ceramic coating |

**Operating principle:**
1. Melt enters the crystallizer
2. Shell solidifies on walls (copper removes heat)
3. Rolls pull the ingot downward
4. Core solidifies as it moves

---

### Gas Cutting

The continuous ingot is cut into 6 m billets.

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Method | Oxy-acetylene cutting |
| Cutting frequency | Every 6 minutes (at 1 m/min speed) |
| Oxygen | From MRE cell |
| Acetylene | Synthesized from calcium carbide (CaC₂) + water |

**Alternative:** Plasma cutting (requires more energy but cleaner cuts).

## Two CCMs at the Factory

The Ground Zero Factory is equipped with two CCMs:

| CCM | Metal | Throughput | Output |
|-----|-------|------------|--------|
| CCM-Al | Aluminum | 42 t/day | Ingots 100×100×6000 mm |
| CCM-Fe | Iron | 35 t/day | Billets 100×100×6000 mm |

**Roller table:** A conveyor roller system transports ingots to the rolling mill.

---

## Operating Modes

### Continuous casting (main mode)

- Tundish continuously supplies melt
- CCM operates 20-22 hours/day
- Stoppages: 2-4 hours for crystallizer replacement (every 5-7 days)

### Emergency shutdown

If melt runs out or quality drops:
1. Tundish stopper closes
2. Rolls continue pulling until crystallizer is empty
3. CCM cools and is cleaned

**Restart time:** 1-2 hours

## Quality Control

| Parameter | Control | Norm | Action on deviation |
|-----------|---------|------|---------------------|
| Melt temperature | Pyrometer | 1500±10°C | Induction heating |
| Withdrawal speed | Encoders on rolls | 0.5-1 m/min | Speed adjustment |
| Cracks on ingot | IR camera | No cracks | Ingot rejection |
| Ingot size | Laser profilometer | 100×100±1 mm | Stop and inspect |

**Automation:** AI system analyzes ingot quality in real time and adjusts parameters.

---

## Power Consumption

| Component | Power | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| NaK cooling (2× CCM) | 50 kW × 2 | Coolant pumps |
| Withdrawal rolls (2× CCM) | 30 kW × 2 | Electric motors |
| Gas cutting | 10 kW | Torches, gas supply |
| Roller table | 20 kW | Ingot transport |
| Automation | 5 kW | Sensors, control |
| **TOTAL** | **~195 kW** | |

---

## Material Balance

**Daily throughput:**

| Metal | Input (melt) | Output (ingots) | Losses |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|--------|
| Aluminum | 41.5 t | 41 t | 1.2% (trim) |
| Iron | 34.5 t | 34 t | 1.5% (trim) |

**Trim:** Periodically remelted in the solar furnace and returned to the cycle.

---

## Maintenance

| Operation | Frequency | Performer |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Crystallizer replacement | 5-7 days | Centaur-M (2 robots) |
| Roller table cleaning | Daily | Crab-M |
| Sensor calibration | Weekly | Automation |
| Roll replacement | 1 month | Centaur-M |

**Crystallizer replacement time:** 2-4 hours (including cooling and disassembly).
