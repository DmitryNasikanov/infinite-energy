## Mass Driver Productivity

### Base Productivity

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Launches per day | **600** |
| Interval between launches | 2.4 minutes |
| Container mass | 115 kg |
| Mirror mass | 100 kg |
| Daily mirror output | **60 tons** |

**Interval calculation:**

```
24 hours = 1440 minutes
1440 / 600 = 2.4 minutes between shots
```

**Annual productivity:**

```
600 launches/day x 365 days = 219,000 launches/year
219,000 x 100 kg = 21,900 tons of mirrors/year ~ 22,000 t
```

### Productivity Constraints

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Coil cooling | 2-3 min between shots |
| Container preparation | Loading + platform spin-up |
| Capacitor charging | 1-2 minutes for full charge |
| Maintenance | Planned shutdown 1 day/month |

**Real productivity:** ~550-600 launches/day under optimal conditions.

## Mirror Scaling

### Realistic Growth Model

**Principle:** First mirrors generate energy -> build new factories -> more mirrors -> even more energy.

Data based on [Roadmap](../../../summaries/roadmap.qmd): Expedition 1 (1 factory) + Expedition 2 (+3 factories by month 5) -> exponential factory and Mass Driver growth.

| Year | Factories | Mass Drivers | Mirrors/year | Accumulated |
|------|-----------|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| 1 | 25 | 12 | ~2.6 M | 2.6 M |
| 2 | 120 | 80 | ~17.5 M | 20 M |
| 3 | 500 | 400 | ~88 M | 108 M |
| 4 | ~1,650 | 1,000 | ~219 M | 327 M |
| 5 | ~1,650 | 1,000 | 219 M | 546 M |
| 6 | ~1,650 | 1,000 | 219 M | 765 M |
| **7** | **~1,650** | **1,000** | **219 M** | **984 M** |

**Key point:** ~1 billion mirrors in ~5 years (1,000 MD plateau by year 4). Accounting for degradation (3-5%/year) — ~1.1 billion active mirrors in **~9.5 years**.

::: {.callout-note}
## Theoretical Potential
With unlimited resources and without expedition logistics, exponential growth can be faster: 1 -> 10 -> 100 -> 500 -> 1,000 -> 2,000 -> 3,500 MDs in 7 years. The realistic model above accounts for factory deployment from the [Roadmap](../../../summaries/roadmap.qmd).

### Growth Rates

**Growth phases:**

1. **Years 1-2: Initial phase** (12-80 MD)
   - Manual process tuning
   - Robot debugging
   - Productivity: 50-70% of theoretical

2. **Years 3-4: Exponential growth** (400-1,000 MD)
   - Full automation
   - Factory self-replication
   - Productivity: 80-90%

3. **Year 5+: Full capacity** (1,000 MD, ~1,650 factories)
   - Parallel factories
   - Maintenance and replacement mode
   - Productivity: 90-95%

### Scaling Scenarios

#### Conservative (doubling every 2 years)

```
Year 1: 1 MD
Year 3: 4 MD
Year 5: 16 MD
Year 7: 64 MD
Year 9: 256 MD

1 billion mirrors: ~12-15 years
```

#### Aggressive (doubling every 1.5 years)

```
Year 1: 1 MD
Year 2.5: 4 MD
Year 4: 16 MD
Year 5.5: 64 MD
Year 7: 256 MD
Year 8.5: 1024 MD

1 billion mirrors: ~7-8 years
```

#### Optimistic (doubling every year)

```
Year 1: 1 MD
Year 2: 4 MD
Year 3: 16 MD
Year 4: 64 MD
Year 5: 256 MD
Year 6: 1024 MD

1 billion mirrors: ~5-6 years
```

**Selected:** Aggressive scenario (doubling every 1.5 years) as realistic with self-replication. Specific data — see the realistic growth model above.

## Energy Consumption

### Launch Energy

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Energy per launch | 4.7 GJ |
| Launches per day | 600 |
| Daily energy | 2.82 TJ |
| **Average power** | **33 MW** |

**Peak power:** 390 MW (12 seconds of acceleration)

### Mirror Production Energy

| Stage | Power | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Aluminum smelting | 12 MW | 70 t/day, 15 kWh/kg |
| Foil rolling | 3 MW | Rolling mill |
| Forming and assembly | 5 MW | Robots + equipment |

```

## Complex Energy Balance

### Solar Panels on Mercury

**Before first mirror** the complex runs on surface solar panels:

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Insolation (Solar Boost) | 9-14 kW/m² |
| GaAs panel efficiency | 30% |
| Output | 2.7-4.2 kW/m² |
| Consumption | 55 MW |
| **Required area** | **13,000-20,000 m²** |

**With 30% margin:** ~**25,000-35,000 m²** of panels.

### Transition to Dyson Swarm Mirrors

**First mirror 100x100 m:**

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Mirror area | 10,000 m² |
| Insolation (Mercury orbit) | 10,343 W/m² |
| Reflected power (90% efficiency) | **93 MW** |
| At receiver (losses ~15%) | ~80 MW |
| Electricity (GaAs 30%) | **~24 MW** |

**First mirror energy balance:**

```
Complex consumption: 55 MW
Output from 1 mirror: ~24 MW

Deficit: -31 MW
```

**First mirror does not cover requirements!** ~3 mirrors needed for self-sufficiency:

```
3 mirrors x 24 MW = 72 MW
Surplus: +17 MW
```

**With high-efficiency concentrators (45% efficiency):**

```
Output: 3 x 36 MW = 108 MW
Surplus: +53 MW
```

**Conclusion:** After launching **3 mirrors** the complex becomes self-sufficient. Surplus is directed to:
- Building new factories
- Expanding robot production
- Peak load reserves

### Long-term Balance

| Phase | Mirrors | Power (for Mercury) | Mass Drivers | Consumption |
|-------|---------|---------------------|--------------|-------------|
| Start | 0 | 0 MW | 1 | 55 MW |
| Self-sufficiency | 3 | 72 MW | 1 | 55 MW |
| Year 1 | 2.6 M | 60 TW | 12 | 0.7 GW |
| Year 3 | 108 M | 2,500 TW | 400 | 22 GW |
| Year 7 | 984 M | 23 PW | 1,000 | 55 GW |

> **Note:** Mercury power = reflected power (~93 MW/mirror x 0.25 for mirrors directed at Mercury). ~18% is transmitted to Earth via LSP stations.

**Conclusion:** Swarm energy exceeds production consumption by **orders of magnitude**.
