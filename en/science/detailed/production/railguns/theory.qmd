## Basic Parameters

### Launch Physics

The Mercurian Mass Driver is an electromagnetic launcher that accelerates a 115 kg container with a mirror to **escape velocity** from Mercury.

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Mercury escape velocity | 4.3 km/s |
| Target velocity | **5 km/s** (16% margin) |
| Track length | **1 km** (base configuration)* |
| Acceleration | **12,500 m/s² (1275g)** |
| Acceleration time | **~0.4 sec** |

*When reducing load: 2 km (637g) or 3 km (425g). All options have 20x+ margin vs proven 25,000g.

### Track Length Options

The base configuration (1 km) is chosen for maximum construction speed. If reducing load is needed, the track can be extended:

| Parameter | **1 km (base)** | 2 km | 3 km |
|-----------|-----------------|------|------|
| Acceleration | **1275g** | 637g | 425g |
| Acceleration time | 0.4 sec | 0.8 sec | 1.2 sec |
| MD mass | **~450 t** | ~875 t | ~1300 t |
| Construction time | **~25 days** | ~40 days | ~60 days |
| Margin vs 25,000g | 20x | 39x | 59x |
| Peak power | 11.8 GW | 5.9 GW | 3.9 GW |

**Choice finalized during detailed design** considering:
- Lunar prototype test results (~640g)
- Actual packaging survivability at high g
- Available production capacity

**Why 5 km/s instead of 4.3 km/s?**

- 4.3 km/s is the theoretical minimum to escape the gravity well
- **+0.7 km/s margin** for trajectory correction, dispersion losses, maneuvering in the Swarm

### Launch Energy

```
Container mass: 115 kg (100 kg mirror + 15 kg container)
Velocity: 5000 m/s

E = ½ × m × v²
E = ½ × 115 × (5000)² = 1.44 GJ
```

**Energy per ton of mirrors:**
- 1 container = 100 kg of mirror
- 10 containers = 1 ton
- **14.4 GJ/ton of mirrors**

### Mass Driver Efficiency

The electromagnetic accelerator has losses from:
- Coil resistance (Joule heating)
- Eddy currents in rails
- Parasitic magnetic fields

| Coil material | Efficiency at +20C | Efficiency at -180C |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Copper (Cu) | 40-45% | — (not available on Mercury) |
| Aluminum (Al) | 25-30% | **35-40%** |

**Solution: Cryo-aluminum** (see [section below](#cryo-aluminum))

### Energy Including Efficiency

```
Efficiency: 40% (cryo-aluminum -180C)
Useful energy: 1.44 GJ
Consumed energy: 1.44 / 0.40 = 3.6 GJ

For capacitors (charge/discharge efficiency 77%):
3.6 / 0.77 = 4.7 GJ per launch
```

**Average power consumption:**
- 4.7 GJ over 0.4 seconds = **11.8 GW peak power** (from NaS capacitors)
- 600 launches/day × 4.7 GJ = 2.82 TJ/day
- **Average power: 33 MW**

## Mass Driver Construction

### NASA Mass Driver Study (1977)

The concept is based on NASA research from the late 20th century: a linear accelerator with **contactless electromagnetic acceleration**.

**References:**
- [NASA Mass Driver Concept (1977)](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19770010564)
- [Electromagnetic Launch - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_driver)

### Adaptation for Mercury

| Parameter | NASA Moon (1977) | Mercury (2025+) |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------|
| Target velocity | 2.4 km/s | **5 km/s** |
| Track length | ~10 km | **1 km*** |
| Acceleration | 25g | **1275g** |
| Coil material | Copper | **Cryo-aluminum** |
| Cooling | Passive | **Active radiators** |

*Optionally 2-3 km when reducing acceleration to 425-637g.

### Mass Driver Materials

```{ojs}
unitWidget("EQU-001")
```

**Main components:**
- **Rails:** Steel Fe-6%Mn (wear resistance)
- **Coils:** Aluminum (cooled to -180C)
- **Frame:** Steel Fe-6%Mn (1 km tunnel)
- **Capacitors:** Na + S + Al₂O₃ (100 GJ energy)
- **Electronics:** Import from Earth (7 tons)

Details:
- [Rail production](elements/rails.qmd)
- [Coil production](elements/coils.qmd)
- [Frame production](elements/frame.qmd)

### Spinning Platform

**Problem:** The projectile must exit the accelerator on a precisely defined trajectory (±0.1°).

**Solution:** Spinning platform at the tunnel exit:
- Container is spun up to 60-120 rpm **before firing**
- Centrifugal force stabilizes the container at exit
- No need for gas thrusters on the container

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Platform diameter | 3-5 m |
| Rotation speed | 60-120 rpm |
| Spin-up time | 10-15 seconds |
| Container moment of inertia | ~130 kg·m² |

**Advantages:**
- Container mass savings (no thrusters)
- Trajectory stabilization (gyroscope)
- Centrifugal mirror deployment

## Cryo-Aluminum {#cryo-aluminum}

### Problem: No Copper on Mercury

Mercury regolith contains **0.001% copper** — virtually zero concentration. Importing 1000 tons of copper for one Mass Driver is economically infeasible.

| Material | Conductivity at +20C | Conductivity at -180C |
|----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Copper (Cu) | 100% (58 MS/m) | 400% |
| Aluminum (Al) | 60% (35 MS/m) | **360%** |

**Conclusion:** At -180C, aluminum reaches 360% of room temperature conductivity, which is 6× higher than normal aluminum.

### Solution: Stationary Placement in Shadow

Mass Drivers are placed in stationary positions optimized by coordinates (latitude, longitude) for maximum time in shadow. Mercury's dark side has **-180C** — aluminum coils are naturally cooled:

1. **Mass Driver coils** — aluminum (local production), naturally cryogenic in shadow
2. **Solar panels** — nearby, on the sunlit side
3. **NaK loop** — heat removal from launches (not for cryo-cooling coils)

| Configuration | Efficiency | Conditions | Import |
|---------------|------------|------------|--------|
| Solar period (+20C) | 25-30% | Reduced effectiveness | 0 t |
| **Shadow period (-180C)** | **35-40%** | Natural cooling | 0 t |
| Copper import | 40-45% | Simple | **~1000 t/MD** |

**Implications:**
- Efficiency 35-40% for most of the Mercurian day (same as room-temperature copper)
- Zero import of materials for coils
- NaK loop needed only for launch heat removal, not for cryo-cooling

## Known Limitations

> **Warning:** This section describes problems requiring solutions.

### Critical Issues

#### 1. Heat Dissipation During Launch

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Energy per launch | 4.7 GJ |
| Efficiency | 40% |
| Heat per shot | **2.8 GJ = 280 MW for 10 sec** |
| Interval between shots | 2-3 minutes |

**Problem:** 280 MW of heat must be removed in 2-3 minutes. At 600 shots/day — continuous heat dissipation ~40 MW.

**Consequences:**
- Coil overheating → efficiency drop → more heat
- Thermal expansion of rails → projectile jamming
- Coil insulation degradation

**Solution:**
- In shadow period (-180C): large delta-T simplifies heat radiation — radiators are more compact
- NaK loop for launch heat removal (coils are already naturally cold)
- In solar period: reduced firing rate or standby

#### 2. No Copper on Mercury ✅ Solved

See [Cryo-Aluminum section](#cryo-aluminum) above.

### High Priority Issues

#### 3. Rail Erosion Underestimated

| Parameter | In calculations | Realistic estimate |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Rail service life | 1-2 years | **3-6 months** |
| Replacement per year | 100 t Al | **300-400 t Al** |

**Causes:**
- Electric arc at high currents
- Mechanical wear at 1275g
- Thermal cycling (cold → hot in seconds)

**Annual replacement consumption (1 Mass Driver):**

```
Rails: 300-400 t aluminum
Coils: 30 t aluminum
Capacitors: 20 t
Electronics: 0.5 t (import)

TOTAL: ~350-450 t/year local + 0.5 t import
```

#### 4. Vibrations at 1275g

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Acceleration | 12,500 m/s² (1275g) |
| Force on 115 kg carriage | **1.44 MN (144 tons)** |
| Tunnel length | 1 km |

**Problems:**
- High dynamic loads on structure
- Resonances at certain firing frequencies
- Rapid guide wear

**Solution:** Massive foundation, dampers, regular calibration. Short track (1 km) simplifies maintenance.

### Requiring Research

#### 5. Dust Protection in Tunnel

- Mercury's electrostatic dust penetrates everywhere
- Dielectric properties of dust → electrical breakdowns
- Abrasiveness → carriage bearing wear

**Requires:** Dust-proof airlocks, purging (with what?), electrostatic filters.

#### 6. Payload Survivability at 1275g ✅ Solved

Research confirms electronics operability at extreme accelerations:

| System | Acceleration | Year | Source |
|--------|--------------|------|--------|
| HIBEX missile | 400g | 1960s | US Army MRE |
| McCormick Stevenson GNC | **25,000g** | 2024 | AIAA |
| SpinLaunch | 10,000g | 2024 | Flight tests |
| Green Launch | 3,200g | 2025 | Satellite tests |

**Conclusion:** 1275g acceleration has **20x margin** vs proven 25,000g (McCormick Stevenson).

**Component protection:**

| Component | Mass | Force at 1275g | Protection |
|-----------|------|----------------|------------|
| Aluminum foil | 100 kg | 127 t | Rolled into rigid Ti/Fe container |
| Weights (4 pcs) | 3 kg | 3.8 t | Built into container |
| Cables (4 pcs) | 2 kg | 2.5 t | Wound on spools |
| Electronics | 0.05 kg | 64 kg | Ti/Al brackets + liquid glass (Na₂SiO₃) |

**Deployment:** Centrifugal unfolding in space using IKAROS principle.

## Lunar Mass Driver

### Purpose

**Mass Driver technology testing** before Mercury deployment. The Moon is a proving ground where mistakes are cheaper: communication 1.3 sec (vs 8-20 min), delivery 3 days (vs months).

### Comparison with Mercurian

| Parameter | Mercury | Moon |
|-----------|---------|------|
| Escape velocity | 4.3 km/s | **2.4 km/s** |
| Target velocity | 5 km/s | **2.5 km/s** |
| Track length | **1 km** | **0.5-1 km** |
| Energy per ton | 14.4 GJ | **3-4 GJ** |
| Gravity | 0.38g | 0.16g |
| Acceleration | **1275g** | **~640g** |

**Conclusion:** The Lunar Mass Driver is comparable in length (0.5-1 km vs 1 km), with ~640g acceleration (~2x lower than Mercury) — suitable for technology development before transitioning to the high-g Mercurian version.

### Launch Energy (Moon)

```
For 1 ton of cargo:
E = 0.5 × 1000 × (2500)² = 3.125 GJ

With 40% efficiency: 7.8 GJ/ton
```

### Orbital Mechanics

| Route | Delta-V | Flight time |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| Moon → L1 | 2.5 km/s | 4-5 days |
| Moon → GEO | 2.2-3.0 km/s | 5-7 days |
| L1 → GEO | 0.7 km/s | ~1 day |

The Mass Driver gives the module a velocity of ~2.5 km/s. A small correction (~0.3 km/s) directs the cargo to L1 point.

### Applications

- Prototype for Mercurian Mass Driver — design validation
- Testing of cooling and electronics systems
- Robot training on launch operations
- Materials produced on the Moon from regolith

::: {.callout-warning}
## Historical Note

Originally planned to use the Lunar Mass Driver to launch orbital Hub modules to L1 point. Concept rejected — instead of orbital Hub, we use LSP stations on the lunar surface.

Details: [Energy Reception Hub](../../hub.qmd#alternative-architectures)
:::

### Construction

The Lunar Mass Driver is built **before** Mercury factory deployment:

1. The Moon is a proving ground for technology development
2. Mass Driver on the Moon is a prototype for Mercury
3. After successful tests — Mass Driver construction on Mercury

## Earth Prototypes: Maglev Technology

Mass Drivers use the same technology as high-speed maglev trains — **linear electric motors**. The principle is identical: electromagnetic coils are sequentially energized, accelerating an object without physical contact.

| Application | Acceleration | Speed | Passengers |
|-------------|--------------|-------|------------|
| Maglev train | 0.1-0.3g | 600 km/h | Yes |
| Mass Driver | 20-50g | 5-10 km/s | No (cargo only) |

## China Breakthrough (December 2025)

Researchers at China's National University of Defense Technology (NUDT) accelerated a 1-ton test car to **700 km/h in 2 seconds** — a world record for superconducting electrodynamic suspension.

Key quote: *"Milestone opens up new possibilities for... aerospace boost launches"* — direct mention of space launch applications.

- [SCMP: China's record-smashing maglev](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3337735/chinas-record-smashing-maglev-achieves-0-700km/h-acceleration-less-2-seconds)
:::

**Significance for the project:** Mass Driver technology is not a futuristic concept but an actively developing field. China explicitly mentions application for "aerospace boosters."

### EMALS — Production Electromagnetic Catapult

The Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) is a linear induction motor **already deployed on production aircraft carriers**:

| Platform | Country | Parameters |
|----------|---------|------------|
| USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) | USA | 45-ton aircraft, 0 → 250 km/h in 100 m |
| Fujian (CV-18) | China | Indigenous EMALS, 2024 |

**Same physics:** A linear electric motor sequentially energizes sections, accelerating the object without contact. The difference is only in acceleration scale (0.3g for pilots vs 1275g for cargo).
