## Overview

Mass Driver rails are aluminum guides along which the projectile (container with mirror) travels. The rails serve simultaneously as:
- Guides for the projectile
- Electrical conductors
- Part of the electromagnetic circuit

## Rail Design

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Material | 99.5% pure aluminum |
| Cross-section | 200x300 mm (hollow profile, 15 mm wall) |
| Segment length | 10 m |
| Segments per track | 100* (for 1 km track) |
| Rail pair (2 pcs) | ~70 t Al per Mass Driver* |

*Extended tracks: 2 km (200 segments, ~140 t), 3 km (300 segments, ~210 t).

### Rail Profile

```
        300 mm
   +--------------+
   | +----------+ | <- 15 mm wall
   | |          | |
   | |   NaK    | | 200 mm  (cooling cavity)
   | |          | |
   | +----------+ |
   +--------------+

Wall cross-section: 14,100 mm² (0.0141 m²)
For 2 rails x 1 km: 28.2 m³ Al -> ~76 t

## Rail Manufacturing

### Production Process

| Stage | Equipment | Output |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Billet casting | CCM-Al | 100x100 mm billets |
| Rolling to profile | Rolling mill | 200x300 mm profile |
| Cooling channel drilling | CNC mill | 50 mm channel |
| Cutting to segments | Gas cutting | 10 m segments |
| Heat treatment | Induction furnace | Stress relief |
| Surface polishing | Grinding mill | Ra <1 um |

## Cryogenic Cooling

**Problem:** Aluminum has 60% of copper's conductivity at room temperature.

**Solution:** Cooling to -180°C increases aluminum conductivity by 6x.

| Material | Conductivity +20°C | Conductivity -180°C |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Copper | 100% | 400% |
| Aluminum | 60% | **360%** |

**Conclusion:** Cryogenic aluminum at -180°C has conductivity nearly equal to copper at room temperature.

### Cooling System

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Coolant | NaK (sodium-potassium alloy) |
| Coolant temperature | -150°C |
| NaK flow rate | 50 L/min per track |
| Radiators | Directed into shadow (-180°C) |
| Pump power | 100 kW |

## Rail Wear

### Causes of Wear

| Cause | Contribution | Consequences |
|-------|--------------|--------------|
| Electrical arcing | 40% | Surface erosion |
| Mechanical abrasion | 30% | Groove formation |
| Thermal cycling | 20% | Microcracks |
| Oxidation | 10% | Darkening, corrosion |

**Aggravating factor:** 1275g acceleration creates very high mechanical loads over a short time (0.4 sec).

### Service Life

| Operating Mode | Launches | Service Life |
|----------------|----------|--------------|
| Intensive (600/day) | ~50,000 | **3 months** |
| Medium (300/day) | ~50,000 | **6 months** |
| Light (100/day) | ~50,000 | **1.5 years** |

## Material Balance

**Per 1 Mass Driver (new, 1 km track):**

| Component | Al Mass | Production |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| Rails (2 pcs x 1 km) | ~70 t | 42 t/day -> **1.7 days** |

**Replacement (wear, 1 Mass Driver/year):**

| Mode | Replacements/year | Al consumption/year |
|------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Intensive | 4 | 280 t |
| Medium | 2 | 140 t |
| Light | 0.7 | ~50 t |

**At 1000 Mass Drivers (intensive mode):** 280,000 t Al/year for rail replacement alone.

## Quality Control

| Parameter | Test | Standard | Action on Deviation |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------------|
| Conductivity | Eddy current test | >95% IACS | Remelting |
| Flatness | Laser profilometer | +/-0.5 mm | Grinding |
| Microcracks | Ultrasonic | No cracks | Rejection |
| Surface finish | Optical inspection | Ra <1 um | Polishing |

## Rail Installation on Track

| Stage | Time | Robots |
|-------|------|--------|
| Trench preparation | 2 weeks | 10 Moles-M |
| Frame installation | 1 week | 20 Centaurs-M |
| Rail mounting (100 segments) | **1 week** | 20 Centaurs-M |
| Joint welding | 3 days | 10 Centaurs-M |
| Cooling connection | 3 days | 10 Centaurs-M |
| Calibration | 1 day | Automation |

**TOTAL:** ~4 weeks from trench to ready rails.
