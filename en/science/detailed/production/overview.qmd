## Four Production Lines

The Mercury production system consists of four specialized production lines:

### 1. Robot Production

**Goal:** Create autonomous robots for mining, processing, and construction.

**Robot types:**
- **Crab-M:** Logistics, material transport (5 t payload capacity)
- **Centaur-M:** Universal manipulator, assembly, welding
- **Mole-M:** Regolith mining, digging (1 m³ bucket)

**Components:**
- **Frames:** Hybrid Fe/Al structures
- **Batteries:** NaS (sodium-sulfur) locally produced
- **Actuators:** NaK hydraulics

**Production rate:** 1 F-R factory → 5 robots/day on assembly jig

**Details:** [Robot Production](robots/overview.qmd)

---

### 2. Factory Production

**Goal:** Self-replication — F-R factories build new factories from local materials.

**Two factory types** (identical 50×30 m dome, different specialization):

- **F-R (Factory-Replicator):** Robots + domes + equipment + Mass Driver elements. First factory and ~10% of subsequent ones.
- **F-M (Factory-Mirror):** Mirrors only (~400/day). Majority of factories (~90%).

**Main stages:**
- **Material processing:** [Regolith → Al/Fe/Si](materials/overview.qmd)
- **Component fabrication:** Melting → Continuous casting → Rolling → WAAM
- **Final assembly:** F-R: domes + equipment + robots; F-M: mirrors

**Production rate:** Self-replication 1 → ~1,650 factories over ~4 years (bottleneck: Vitamins delivery)

**Details:** [Factory Production](factories/overview.qmd)

---

### 3. Mass Driver Production

**Goal:** Create launch systems for sending mirrors to space (5 km/s, 600 launches/day).

**Main components:**
- **Rails and coils:** Cryogenic aluminum (-180°C)
- **Tunnel frame:** Fe-6%Mn steel (3 km length)
- **Power system:** Capacitors, NaK cooling

**Production rate:** 1 Mass Driver → 70 tons of mirrors/day (219,000 launches/year)

**Details:** [Mass Driver Production](railguns/overview.qmd)

---

### 4. Mirror Production

**Goal:** Create mirrors for the Dyson Swarm (100×100 m, 10,000 m² each).

**Main stages:**
- **Aluminum foil rolling:** 4 μm thickness, 110 kg per mirror
- **Weight and cable production:** Iron 5 kg for tensioning
- **Electronics assembly:** Imported chip + TiO₂ electrochromic strips
- **Folding and packaging:** Z-fold into rigid container for Mass Driver

**Specifications:**
- Size: 100 × 100 m (10,000 m²)
- Mass: 116 kg (110 kg Al + 5 kg Fe + 1 kg TiO₂ + 50 g chip)
- Localization: 99.95% (only control chip imported from Earth)

**Production rate:**
- 1 Mass Driver → 600 mirrors/day (70 t/day)
- 1,000 Mass Drivers → 600,000 mirrors/day (219 million mirrors/year)

**Key principles:**

1. **Regolith processing:** Each factory processes regolith and produces materials (Al/Fe/Si) for its needs ([materials/](materials/overview.qmd))

2. **Specialized assembly lines:** Each factory can specialize in a specific direction:
   - Factories → new factories
   - Railguns → Mass Drivers
   - Robots → autonomous robots
   - Mirrors → mirrors for the Swarm

3. **Closed loop:** Robots mine regolith → materials → production → new robots

## Production Lines

The production system includes several specialized lines:

### 1. Regolith Processing Line

**Purpose:** Extract metals (Al, Fe, Si) from Mercurian regolith

**Process:**
- Regolith mining (Mole-M) → 600 t/day
- Vacuum distillation → volatile fractions
- MRE electrolysis → Al (42 t), Fe-6%Mn (18 t), Si (25 t)

**Details:** [Regolith Processing](materials/overview.qmd)

---

### 2. Metalworking Line

**Purpose:** Transform raw metals into finished parts

**Process:**
- Melting in solar furnaces (1500°C)
- Continuous casting → billets
- Rolling → sheets, profiles
- WAAM 3D printing → complex parts
- CNC machining → final geometry

**Details:** [Equipment Production](factories/assembly/equipment.qmd)

---

### 3. Robot Assembly Line

**Purpose:** Produce autonomous robots for mining, transport, and assembly

**Process:**
- Frames: WAAM printing + CNC machining
- Batteries: NaS cell assembly (Na, S from regolith)
- Actuators: NaK hydraulics
- Final assembly: Jig, 5 robots/day per factory

**Details:** [Robot Production](robots/overview.qmd)

---

### 4. Mirror Assembly Line

**Purpose:** Produce mirrors for the Swarm (100×100 m, 116 kg)

**Process:**
- Aluminum foil rolling (4 μm)
- Weight (Fe) and cable production
- Electronics assembly (imported chip + TiO₂)
- Z-fold folding + container packaging

**Production rate:** 600 mirrors/day per Mass Driver

**Details:** [Mirror Design](../mirrors.qmd)

---

### 5. Mass Driver Construction Line

**Purpose:** Create launch systems for mirrors (5 km/s, 600 launches/day)

**Process:**
- Tunnel frame: Welding Fe-6%Mn sections (3 km)
- Rails: Rolling Al profiles
- Coils: Winding cryogenic aluminum (cooling to -180°C)
- Capacitors: Power system assembly
- Tunnel: Digging by Moles-M + frame installation

**Technology:** Instead of copper, cryogenic aluminum is used — at -180°C its conductivity is 360% (almost like copper at +20°C)

**Details:** [Mass Driver Production](railguns/overview.qmd)

---

### 6. Factory Self-Replication Line

**Purpose:** Copy factory for exponential growth

**Process:**
- Dome production: Glass fabric panels + Al frame
- Equipment production: Continuous caster, rolling mill, CNC
- Systems assembly: Power, control, robots
- Final integration: Connection and testing

**Rate:** 1 new factory in ~3 weeks (practically 4 years for 1→~1,650 due to Vitamins delivery)

**Details:** [Factory Self-Replication](factories/assembly/replication.qmd)

## Material Requirements

> **Key takeaway:** 94% of all materials are aluminum. Maximizing Al production line throughput is critical for project success.

### Production Scale

| Object | Quantity | Unit Mass | Total Mass |
|--------|----------|-----------|------------|
| Mirrors | 1.1 billion | 116 kg | **127.5 million t** |
| Mass Drivers | 1,000 | 1,300 t | **1.3 million t** |
| Robots | 60,000 | 370–1,500 kg | **67,000 t** |
| Factories | 1,000 | 33 t | **33,000 t** |
| **TOTAL** | | | **~129 million t** |

### Distribution by Material

| Material | Mass | Share | Primary Consumer |
|----------|------|-------|------------------|
| **Aluminum (Al)** | 121.5 million t | **94.2%** | Mirrors (95% Al) |
| **Iron (Fe)** | 6.4 million t | **4.9%** | Mass Drivers (62% Fe) |
| Titanium dioxide (TiO₂) | 1.1 million t | 0.85% | Mirror electrochromics |
| Na, S, Si | 8,660 t | <0.01% | Robot batteries |

### Project Mass Structure

    "Mass Drivers" : 1.0
    "Robots + Factories" : 0.1
```

### Production Priorities

1. **Aluminum is the bottleneck.** 121 million tons of Al require maximum throughput of MRE and rolling mill lines.

2. **Mirrors = 99% of mass.** Optimizing mirror production gives the greatest impact on Swarm construction speed.

3. **Robots and factories are a drop in the bucket.** 100,000 tons out of 129 million — less than 0.1%. Their production is not a limiting factor.
