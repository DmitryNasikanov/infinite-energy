## Purpose of the Line

Part of the silicate stream (~5%) goes to glass fiber production directly, bypassing MRE electrolysis.

**Why a separate line:**

- Fiber production requires silicates in their original form (oxides SiO2, CaO, Al2O3)
- In MRE, oxides are decomposed by electrolysis into metals + O2
- If everything were electrolyzed, no silicates would remain for fiber production

## Silicate Composition (Feedstock)

Mercury regolith silicates **already contain** the required composition for glass fiber, similar to industrial E-glass:

| Oxide | Fraction | Role in Glass |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| SiO2 | ~45% | Glass former |
| Al2O3 | ~15% | Strength, chemical resistance |
| CaO | ~10% | Flux (lowers melting point) |
| MgO | ~10% | Strength |
| FeO | ~5% | Impurity (gives greenish tint) |

> **Note:** On Earth, E-glass contains boron (B2O3) to lower the melting temperature. Mercury has no boron, so we melt at a higher temperature (~1400C), which is not a problem for a solar furnace.

| Melting | Silicates melt in solar furnace | 1400C |
| Fiberization | Melt is forced through platinum bushings | 1200C |

| Winding | Fiber is collected onto bobbins | - |

## Equipment

| Component | Function | Materials |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Small solar furnace | Silicate melting | Al mirrors, MgO crucible (local) |
| Platinum bushings | Fiber drawing | Pt-Rh (**import**) |
| Winding drum | Bobbin collection | Fe frame, Al drum |

### Platinum Bushings (Pt-Rh) - Strategic Import

| Parameter | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Kit mass | 200-400 kg Pt-Rh |
| Service life | 3-5 years |
| Replacement rate | ~50-100 kg/year |
| Import type | One-time (at startup) + rare replacements |

> **Why platinum:** Pt withstands 1770C and does not react with molten glass - this is the industry standard. The alternative is tungsten (W) bushings, but they oxidize. **Pt-Rh bushings are the only critical import for this line.**

## Glass Fiber Applications

| Product | Criticality | Purpose | Alternative |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Cable insulation | **Critical** | All factory wiring | Ceramic beads (difficult) |
| Winding insulation | **Critical** | All motors, transformers | Al2O3 ceramics (brittle) |
| Dome fabric | **High** | Al-membrane reinforcement, new factories | Metal only (heavier) |
| Thermal insulation | Medium | Equipment protection | MgO ceramics, vacuum |
| Filters | Low | Gas purification | In vacuum, dust settles by itself |

> **Conclusion:** Glass fiber is a **critical material**. Without it, factory electrics (cables, motors) and expansion (new domes) are impossible. Platinum bushings are a strategic import that must be secured.
