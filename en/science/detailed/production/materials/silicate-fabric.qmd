## Overview

| Parameter | Value |
|----------|----------|
| Input | Silicates (~5% of non-magnetic fraction) |
| Output | Glass fiber |
| Throughput | ~30 t/day |
| Energy consumption | Solar furnace (thermal) |
| Location | **Outside the dome (in vacuum)** |

> **Why vacuum:** The line uses tungsten bushings, which oxidize in the presence of oxygen. In Mercury's vacuum, tungsten withstands up to 2800C without degradation.

## Purpose of the Line

Part of the silicate stream (~5%) goes to glass fiber production directly, bypassing MRE electrolysis.

**Why a separate line:**

- Fiber production requires silicates in their original form (oxides SiO2, CaO, Al2O3)
- In MRE, oxides are decomposed by electrolysis into metals + O2
- If everything were electrolyzed, no silicates would remain for fiber production

## Silicate Composition (Feedstock)

Mercury regolith silicates **already contain** the required composition for glass fiber, similar to industrial E-glass:

| Oxide | Fraction | Role in Glass |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| SiO2 | ~45% | Glass former |
| Al2O3 | ~15% | Strength, chemical resistance |
| CaO | ~10% | Flux (lowers melting point) |
| MgO | ~10% | Strength |
| FeO | ~5% | Impurity (gives greenish tint) |

> **Note:** On Earth, E-glass contains boron (B2O3) to lower the melting temperature. Mercury has no boron, so we melt at a higher temperature (~1400C), which is not a problem for a solar furnace.

## Equipment

| Component | Function | Materials |

| Small solar furnace | Silicate melting | Al mirrors, MgO crucible (local) |
| Tungsten bushings | Fiber drawing | W (**local**) |
| Winding drum | Bobbin collection | Fe frame, Al drum |

### Tungsten Bushings (W) - Local Production

| Parameter | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Kit mass | 200-400 kg W |
| Service life | 3-5 years |
| Source | [Regolith processing](overview.qmd) (tungsten - trace element) |

> **Why tungsten:** On Earth, platinum (Pt-Rh) is used because tungsten oxidizes at >400C in air. But the glass fiber line on Mercury operates **in vacuum**, where tungsten does not oxidize and withstands up to 2800C. This allows complete localization of production without importing precious metals.

## Glass Fiber Applications

| Product | Criticality | Purpose | Alternative |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Cable insulation | **Critical** | All factory wiring | Ceramic beads (difficult) |
| Winding insulation | **Critical** | All motors, transformers | Al2O3 ceramics (brittle) |
| Dome fabric | **High** | Al-membrane reinforcement, new factories | Metal only (heavier) |
| Thermal insulation | Medium | Equipment protection | MgO ceramics, vacuum |
| Filters | Low | Gas purification | In vacuum, dust settles by itself |

> **Conclusion:** Glass fiber is a **critical material**. Without it, factory electrics (cables, motors) and expansion (new domes) are impossible. By locating the line in vacuum, the entire line is **fully localized** - tungsten bushings are produced from local feedstock.
