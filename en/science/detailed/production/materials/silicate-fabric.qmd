## Purpose of the Line

Part of the silicate stream (~5%) goes to glass fiber production directly, bypassing MRE electrolysis.

**Why a separate line:**

- Fiber production requires silicates in their original form (oxides SiO2, CaO, Al2O3)
- In MRE, oxides are decomposed by electrolysis into metals + O2
- If everything were electrolyzed, no silicates would remain for fiber production

## Silicate Composition (Feedstock)

Mercury regolith silicates **already contain** the required composition for glass fiber, similar to industrial E-glass:

| Oxide | Fraction | Role in Glass |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| SiO2 | ~45% | Glass former |
| Al2O3 | ~15% | Strength, chemical resistance |
| CaO | ~10% | Flux (lowers melting point) |
| MgO | ~10% | Strength |
| FeO | ~5% | Impurity (gives greenish tint) |

> **Note:** On Earth, E-glass contains boron (B2O3) to lower the melting temperature. Mercury has no boron, so we melt at a higher temperature (~1400C), which is not a problem for a solar furnace.

## Equipment

| Component | Function | Materials |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Small solar furnace | Silicate melting | Al mirrors, MgO crucible (local) |
| Ceramic bushings | Fiber drawing | Al₂O₃ (**local**) |
| Winding drum | Bobbin collection | Fe frame, Al drum |

### Ceramic Bushings (Al₂O₃) - Local Production

| Parameter | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Material | Al₂O₃ (corundum) |
| Operating temperature | up to 1800°C (glass fiber 1200-1400°C ✓) |
| Service life | 3-5 years |
| Source | [Regolith processing](overview.qmd) (Al 7% + O₂ 45%) |

> **Why ceramics:** On Earth, platinum (Pt-Rh) is traditionally used. Scientific research has shown that **Al₂O₃ ceramic bushings** produce fibers of comparable quality ([ScienceDirect, 1981](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0261306981900510)). Al₂O₃ is produced from local feedstock (Al 7%, O₂ 45% of regolith per [MESSENGER](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1211567)).

### Design

| Element | Material | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Crucible | MgO ceramics (local) | Silicate melting |
| Bushings | Al₂O₃ ceramics (local) | Fiber forming |
| Cooling | Air (dome atmosphere) | Fiber cooling |

## Glass Fiber Applications

| Product | Criticality | Purpose | Alternative |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Cable insulation | **Critical** | All factory wiring | Ceramic beads (difficult) |
| Winding insulation | **Critical** | All motors, transformers | Al2O3 ceramics (brittle) |
| Dome fabric | **High** | Al-membrane reinforcement, new factories | Metal only (heavier) |
| Thermal insulation | Medium | Equipment protection | MgO ceramics, vacuum |
| Filters | Low | Gas purification | In vacuum, dust settles by itself |

> **Conclusion:** Glass fiber is a **critical material**. Without it, factory electrics (cables, motors) and expansion (new domes) are impossible. The line is **fully localized** — Al₂O₃ ceramic bushings are produced from local feedstock (Al 7%, O₂ 45% of regolith).
