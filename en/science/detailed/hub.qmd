## Concept

The mirror swarm in Mercury's orbit produces petawatts of energy. But this energy is concentrated sunlight. It needs to be converted to a form suitable for transmission to Earth.

```

Concept by [David Criswell](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329718124_Solar_Power_via_the_Moon_2002): placing receivers on the Moon's surface with microwave power transmission.

## Geometry: Why Limbs?

The Moon is tidally locked — one side always faces Earth. This creates a problem:

| Position on Moon | Sees Swarm? | Sees Earth? |
|------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Near side | Partially | **Yes** |
| Far side | Yes | No |
| **Limbs (edges)** | **Yes** | **Yes** |

**Solution:** 20-40 stations on the eastern and western limbs of the Moon.

### Continuity of Operation

```{mermaid}

        C["Weeks 3-4"] -->|Eastern limb| D["Operating"]
    end
    B --> E["Continuous transmission to Earth"]
    D --> E

    style cycle fill:#F5F5F5,stroke:#616161,color:#212121
```

Stations on both limbs ensure continuous operation throughout the lunar month.

## Receiving Energy from the Swarm

### Mirror Clusters

Swarm mirrors are organized into **local clusters** of 1,000-10,000 units. Each cluster:

- Synchronizes internally (delay ~0.3 ms)
- Directs reflected light to designated LSP station
- Forms a virtual antenna ~100 km in diameter

### Beam Spreading

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Distance Mercury → Moon | ~100 million km |
| Virtual antenna diameter | ~100 km |
| Beam spreading | ~1 km |
| LSP receiver size | 5-10 km |

The beam spreads to ~1 km — the LSP receiver fully captures it.

### Photovoltaics on the Moon

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Receiver area (per station) | ~10 km² |
| Total area (20 stations) | ~200 km² |
| PV efficiency (concentration) | ~45% |
| Type | Multi-junction, from lunar silicon |

---

## Transmission to Earth

### Why Microwaves?

| Parameter | Microwaves | Laser |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| Passes through clouds | **Yes** | No |
| Transmission efficiency | ~85% | ~70% |
| Earth receiver | Rectenna | Thermal boiler |
| Technology maturity | High | Medium |

**Microwaves selected** — they pass through clouds and rain, enabling operation in any weather.

### Global Rectenna Network

The Moon is visible ~12 hours from any point on Earth. Solution — **global rectenna network**:

| Time UTC | Moon over | Active rectenna | Energy goes to |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| 00:00 | Pacific Ocean | Australia | Asia |
| 06:00 | India | Gobi (China) | Asia, Europe |
| 12:00 | Africa | Sahara | Europe, Americas |
| 18:00 | Atlantic | Atacama (Chile) | Americas |

**Principle:** Rectenna receives → HVDC cables transmit to global grid → consumers receive continuously.

**Buffering:** 1-2 hours of batteries smooth transitions between rectennas.

**Advantage over solar:** The Moon is visible day and night — easier to ensure continuity.

## Earth Receivers (Rectenna)

### Scale

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Target power | 1 PW (50× global) |
| Power per rectenna | ~1 TW |
| Number of stations | **~100** |
| Area per rectenna | ~100 km² (10×10 km) |

### Locations

Rectennas are placed in **sparsely populated regions** — both in deserts for large-scale generation and closer to consumers:

| Region | Location | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **Russia** | Yakutia | Close to consumers, sparsely populated |
| **Russia/Asia** | Kazakhstan | Steppes, Central Asia |
| **Europe** | Southern Spain | Semi-desert, close to consumers |
| **Scandinavia** | Finland/Sweden | Northern Europe, sparsely populated |
| **USA** | Nevada/Arizona | Desert, central North America |
| **Mexico** | Sonora/Chihuahua | Desert, southern North America |
| **Canada** | Saskatchewan/Manitoba | Prairies, northern North America |
| **China** | Xinjiang (Taklamakan) | Large-scale generation, close to consumers |
| **India** | Rajasthan (Thar) | Close to consumers, high demand |
| Africa | Sahara | Large-scale generation |
| Asia | Gobi (Mongolia) | Large-scale generation |
| S. America | Atacama (Chile) | Large-scale generation |
| Oceania | Central Australia | Large-scale generation |

### Construction

A rectenna is an array of dipoles converting microwave radiation to electricity:

1. Microwaves from LSP hit dipoles
2. Dipoles generate alternating current
3. Rectifiers convert to direct current
4. HVDC transmits to grid

**Rectenna efficiency:** ~85%

## Microwave Transmission Safety

Microwaves are safer than laser but require strict zoning.

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Intensity on rectenna (center) | **10,000 W/m²** (10× sun) |
| Sun at noon | 1,000 W/m² |
| ICNIRP standard (public) | 10 W/m² |

> **Note:** Power density of 10,000 W/m² matches real NASA (1978), JAXA, and modern SBSP concepts. See [PMC: SBSP Review](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11064435/).

### Territory Zoning

| Zone | Intensity | Access |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Center | 10,000 W/m² | **Restricted zone** (automated) |
| Middle | 100–1,000 W/m² | Technical personnel (limited) |
| Periphery | <50 W/m² | Security perimeter |
| Border | <10 W/m² | Meets ICNIRP standards |

```{mermaid}
flowchart TB
    subgraph rectenna["RECTENNA (100 km²)"]
        subgraph mid["Middle zone: 100-1000 W/m² — Technical personnel"]
            subgraph center["Center: 10,000 W/m² — Restricted zone"]
                A["Automated, no people"]
            end
        end
    end
    B["Periphery: <50 W/m² — Security"]
    C["Border: <10 W/m² — Safe"]

    style rectenna fill:#E8F5E9,stroke:#4CAF50,color:#1B5E20
    style mid fill:#FFF3E0,stroke:#FF9800,color:#E65100
    style center fill:#FFEBEE,stroke:#F44336,color:#B71C1C
```

**Safety:** Rectenna territory is fully fenced. System automatically shuts off when objects enter the beam (birds, aircraft).

## Building LSP

### Lunar Manufacturing

LSP is built from materials produced on the Moon — **not delivered from Earth**:

| Component | Material | Source |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Photovoltaics | Silicon | Moon (regolith) |
| Structure | Aluminum | Moon (anorthosite) |
| Antennas | Aluminum | Moon |
| Electronics | Chips | Earth (~0.1%) |

> **Unified technology:** The same Gen-2/Gen-3 robots that build factories on Mercury also work on the Moon. Lunar production is technology validation before Mercury. See [Robot Bestiary](robots/overview.qmd).

### Advantages of Lunar Manufacturing

| Parameter | On Moon | From Earth |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| Gravity | 0.16g | 1g |
| Resources | In-situ | Delivery |
| Radiators | Ground | In vacuum |
| Heat | Dissipates into rock | Needs radiators |

**Key advantage:** On the Moon, heat from conversion dissipates into the ground. No giant radiators needed.

### Logistics

1. **[Lunar factory](../summaries/moon.qmd)** produces LSP modules
2. **[Mass Driver](railguns/theory.qmd#lunar-mass-driver)** delivers to limbs (not needed for LSP!)
3. **Rovers** transport across surface to limbs
4. **Robots** assemble stations

### Construction Rates

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Total mass of 30 LSP + 100 rectennas | ~178,000 t |
| Construction period | 3-5 years |
| Production rate | ~50,000 t/year |

## System Components

The Hub Station consists of three main subsystems working as unified infrastructure:

### Lunar LSP Stations

- **Quantity**: 20-40 stations on Moon's limbs
- **Photovoltaic area**: ~10 km² per station (total ~300 km²)
- **Materials**: Multi-junction photocells from lunar silicon (Si), aluminum (Al) frames and supports
- **Production**: Local, from lunar regolith

### Microwave Transmitters

- **Location**: On lunar LSP stations
- **Technology**: Klystrons with 90% efficiency
- **Function**: Convert electricity to microwaves for Earth transmission

### Earth Rectennas

- **Quantity**: ~100 stations worldwide
- **Size**: ~100 km² each (10×10 km), total ~10,000 km² receiving area
- **Materials**: Dipole arrays from aluminum (Al) or copper (Cu), silicon (Si) rectifier diodes — **Earth production**
- **Function**: Receive microwaves and convert to direct current (HVDC)

### Full System Composition

```{ojs}

```

> **Note**: Widget shows composition of **lunar LSP stations** (30 units). Earth rectennas are produced on Earth from local materials and are not part of the project's space logistics.

## System Efficiency

| Stage | Efficiency |
|-------|------------|
| Mirror reflection | 90% |
| Orbit geometry | 72% |
| Concentration to Moon | 90% |
| PV on lunar stations | 45% |
| DC → Microwaves (Klystron) | 90% |
| Transmission Moon → Earth | 95% |
| Atmospheric passage | 95% |
| Rectenna on Earth | 85% |
| **Total efficiency** | **18%** |

**Calculation:** $\eta = 0.90 \times 0.72 \times 0.90 \times 0.45 \times 0.90 \times 0.95 \times 0.95 \times 0.85 = 0.18$

> **Comparison:** Orbital Hub with laser — only ~10% efficiency due to double conversion (light → laser → heat).

---

## Energy Distribution

All Swarm energy is first received at lunar LSP stations, then distributed:

| Stage | Recipient | Power | % of Swarm |
|-------|-----------|-------|------------|
| **1. Reception** | **Moon (LSP)** | **~20 PW** | **100%** |
| ↳ 2a. Transmission | Earth (rectennas) | 1 PW | 5% |
| ↳ 2b. Transmission | Mars (future) | 1-5 PW | 5-25% |
| ↳ 2c. Local | Moon (furnaces) | ~0.5 PW | ~2.5% |
| ↳ 2d. Buffer | Moon (reserve) | ~13-17 PW | ~65-85% |

**Details of lunar usage:**
- **Furnaces:** Melting regolith in solar furnaces, MRE electrolysis, materials production
- **Reserve:** NaS batteries for peak load smoothing, future production expansion

> **Why not all to Earth?** 1 PW = 1000 TW — this is 50 times global consumption (20 TW). It's enough for complete decarbonization, synthetic fuels, and industrial growth. For Mars terraforming, energy is directed straight to Mars (1-5 PW), bypassing Earth. The rest is reserve for space expansion.

## Alternative Architectures

### Orbital Hub at L1

::: {.callout-warning}
## Concept Rejected
Analysis showed economic infeasibility: 10% efficiency vs 18% for LSP, need to build 7,900 km² radiators in space.
:::

**Idea:** Station at L1 point (Earth-Moon, 326,000 km from Earth) receives light from Swarm and transmits by laser to Earth.

| Problem | Hub (L1) | LSP (Moon) |
|---------|----------|------------|
| Efficiency | 10% | **18%** |
| Radiators | 7,900 km² in space | 0 (ground) |
| Structure mass | 15 million t in orbit | ~178,000 t on surface |
| Construction | In microgravity | With gravity |
| Resources | Delivery from Moon | In-situ |

**Why such large radiators?** At 35% efficiency at light→laser stage, about 65% of energy becomes heat. In vacuum, the only way to dump heat is radiation. At 1000K a radiator emits ~57 kW/m². For 0.45 PW, 7,900 km² area is needed.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Hub Construction Details (for reference)

**Components:**

| Component | Area | Mass |
|-----------|------|------|
| Receiver (photovoltaics) | 45 km² | ~0.5 million t |
| **Radiators** | **7,900 km²** | **~12 million t** |
| Laser array | — | ~1.5 million t |
| Structure + systems | — | ~1 million t |
| **Total** | | **~15 million t** |

**Cost (from Moon):** $50-95 billion

### GEO Station + Space Elevator

Alternative — geosynchronous orbit (36,000 km) with space elevator to reduce delivery costs.

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
    A["Mirror Swarm"] --> B["SPS on GEO"]
    B --> C["Microwaves"]
    C --> D["Rectenna"]
    E["Space Elevator<br/>($100/kg vs $2000/kg)"] --> B
```

**Advantages:**
- Station always above same point on Earth
- Elevator reduces delivery cost 20×

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires space elevator technology (not yet available)
- Still needs radiators in space

---

### Direct Solar Lasers

Concentrated light directly pumps laser medium — no PV, no electricity.

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Theoretical limit | 31% |
| Practical (2025) | 6-8% |
| Status | Promising technology |

**Advantage:** No diodes that degrade.

---

## Architecture Comparison

| Option | Efficiency | Radiators | Maturity | Status |
|--------|------------|-----------|----------|--------|
| **Lunar LSP + Microwaves** | **18%** | **0 (ground)** | High | **Selected** |
| Orbital Hub (L1) + Laser | 10% | 7,900 km² | Low | Rejected |
| GEO Station + Elevator | 15-20% | Present | Medium | Alternative |

**Conclusion:** Lunar LSP is the most efficient architecture with twice the efficiency and no radiators in space.
