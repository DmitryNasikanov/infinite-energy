## Objective and Calculation Status

The purpose of this documentation is to confirm the **fundamental feasibility** of the project and provide preliminary estimates for budgets and timelines. Calculations confirm: all necessary technologies exist (MRE electrolysis, WAAM, solar concentration, electromagnetic launch), materials on Mercury are present in sufficient quantities (Al, Fe, Si, Ti, S), and delivery logistics are realistic given current launch cost trends.

All numbers provided (areas, throughputs, material flows) are **preliminary order-of-magnitude estimates**. Transitioning to implementation requires a professional engineering team for parameter refinement, detailed design, and validation of adopted solutions.

## Production System Overview

The project uses **two production centers** with different tasks and conditions. This is not duplication but specialization - each location does what it does best. Production develops in three phases:

### Preparation: Earth -> Moon (years 1-6)

**Production Logic:**

1. **Preparation (years 1-6):** R&D and prototyping (years 1-4), lunar testbed (years 4-6). The Moon validates extraction, smelting, and assembly technologies in vacuum and low gravity conditions.

2. **Scaling (from year 6):** Knowledge from the Moon is applied on Mercury. The Ground Zero Factory copies itself exponentially, reaching ~1650 factories (~1500 F-M + ~150 F-R). Mirrors are produced and sent to the Swarm.

3. **Energy cycle (from year 7):** The Dyson Swarm reflects light to lunar LSP stations. LSP converts light to microwaves and transmits to Earth. Closed cycle: energy -> production -> more energy.

**Why doesn't the Moon send robots to Mercury?**

Mercury produces its own robots - this is part of factory self-replication. The Moon only transfers knowledge and experience (software, procedures, debugging). Physical delivery of robots from Moon to Mercury is economically impractical (delta-v ~13 km/s).

### Why Two Locations Instead of One?

| Factor | Mercury | Moon |
|--------|---------|------|
| **Solar flux** | 9-14 kW/m^2 | 1.4 kW/m^2 |
| **Advantage** | Energy for smelting and self-replication | Proximity to Earth (1.3 sec delay) |
| **Specialization** | Mirrors + self-replication | Testbed + LSP stations |
| **Strategy** | Exponential growth | Validation → LSP production |

**Mercury** is an energy machine. 7x more sunlight means solar furnaces melt metal faster, panels generate more power, and the factory can copy itself without power constraints.

**The Moon** is the gateway to space. A 1.3-second communication delay allows operators to control the process in near real-time — ideal for technology validation (years 4-6). After validation, the Moon transitions to producing LSP stations from local resources (silicon, aluminum).

## Production on Mercury

### Preparatory Phases (pre-launch)

Before launching the factory to Mercury, the project goes through three preparatory phases:

| Phase | Years | Objective | Result |
|-------|-------|-----------|--------|
| **R&D** | 1-2 | Technology development | Robot prototypes, MRE cells, Mass Driver |
| **Earth Testbed** | 2-4 | Testing in controlled environment | Assembly line, lights-out factory |
| **Moon Testbed** | 4-6 | Space validation (1.3 sec delay) | Robots learn to dig, smelt, assemble |
| **Mercury** | 6+ | Production launch | Ground Zero Factory |

**"Faith in success" strategy:** Expedition 2 (robots + materials) launches one month after Expedition 1 lands - before receiving full results. This shortens total project time by ~2 years.

**Details:** [Roadmap](../summaries/roadmap.qmd)

### Ground Zero Factory

> **Detailed article:** [Factory Production](production/factories/overview.qmd) — F-R and F-M layouts, factory types, material flows
>
> **First factory assembly:** [Bootstrap](bootstrap.qmd) — checkpoint model, assembly scenarios

**Project:** Helios Prime
**Document:** First Factory Technology Roadmap
**Status:** 100% of components delivered from Earth

---

> **TL;DR**

> - **First expedition:** ~67 tons from Earth (including 5.25 t GaAs panels), assembly in 7 days
> - **Power reserve:** 113 MW surplus -> bootstrap without Swarm dependency

### General Principles

| Parameter | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Principle | Gravity-flow line + Vacuum distillation |
| External environment | Vacuum |
| Internal dome environment | Oxygen 0.1 atm (local, from MRE) |
| **Dome dimensions** | **~50x30 m (~1500 m^2)** |
| Power consumption (factory only) | 5 MW (peak) |
| Power consumption (entire complex) | 55 MW (factory + Mass Driver + robots) |
| **Available energy (3 GaAs trips)** | **168 MW** (113 MW reserve) |

> **Note:** 5 MW is the energy of the factory itself (smelting, MRE, rolling). The full complex with Mass Driver (~39 MW) consumes 55 MW. With 3 trips of GaAs panels, 168 MW is available - a 113 MW reserve for scaling. See [detailed calculation](#power-consumption-of-1-complex).

### Dome Dimensions and Layout

**Total area:** ~1500 m^2 (~50x30 m) - under 0.1 atm oxygen pressure.

| Zone | Area | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| Continuous casting + tundish | ~200 m^2 | Billet casting |
| Rolling mill | ~300 m^2 | 6 stands + roller tables |
| Wire drawing mill | ~100 m^2 | Wire, cables |
| Assembly jig | ~500 m^2 | 10 robot positions |
| WAAM + CNC | ~150 m^2 | Finishing operations |
| Billet storage | ~150 m^2 | Product buffer |
| Passages and maneuvering | ~100 m^2 | Centaurs, loading |

**Dome height:** 6-8 m (sufficient for 1 t capacity overhead crane).

### Stage 0. Geology and Resources

*Raw material base.*

Mercury is an anomalous planet. A giant metallic core, only lightly covered with rocky crust. The richest deposit in the Solar System.

#### Abundant Elements

| Element | Content | Application |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Aluminum (Al)** | 6-8% of regolith (**42 t/day** at 600 t) | **Mirrors** (95 kg/unit), robot bodies, radiators |
| Silicon (Si) | ~20% of crust | Solar panels, glass, ceramics, electronics |
| Sulfur (S) | Anomalously high | Insulator (sulfide concrete), chemistry, batteries |
| **Iron (Fe)** | 1.5-4% of regolith (**18 t/day** at 600 t) | **Gen-2 Robots** (frames, tracks), MD rails |
| Magnesium (Mg) | Sufficient | Light alloys |
| Titanium (Ti) | Present in ilmenites | High-strength components (spider legs) |
| Sodium (Na) | From feldspars | Coolant (liquid metal) |
| Potassium (K) | From feldspars | Coolant (liquid metal) |

#### Scarce Elements ("Vitamins" from Earth)

| Element | Problem | Solution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Carbon (C) | 1-3% in LRM zones | Graphite: Hadfield steel, lubricants, anodes ([MESSENGER 2016](https://hub.jhu.edu/2016/03/10/carbon-explains-mercury-darkness-apl-study/)) |
| Hydrogen (H) | Only polar ice | Extraction from craters |
| Copper (Cu) | Scarce | Aluminum or sodium wires in steel tubes |
| Tungsten (W) | Critical for cutting tools | Import from Earth |
| Rare earths | Critical for electronics | Import from Earth |
| Argon (Ar) | Absent | Shielding gas for WAAM and refining - import from Earth |
| Oxygen (O2) | From MRE (~1500 t/day) | Dome atmosphere (0.1 atm) |

#### Volatile Compounds

**Water ice (H2O):** Located at the bottom of polar craters. Source of hydrogen (chemistry) and oxygen (oxidizer).

#### "Carbon" Graphite Mining Complexes

LRM zones (with graphite) are located at equatorial latitudes, while factories are at poles. Solution: two specialized complexes.

| Complex | Location | Delivery to pole |
|---------|----------|------------------|
| **Carbon-North** | Rachmaninoff (27 deg N) | Mini MD, ~2800 km |
| **Carbon-South** | Tolstoj (16 deg S) | Mini MD, ~5800 km |

Operating in shifts (equatorial night ~44 days). **Details:** [Regolith Processing](production/materials/overview.qmd)

**Import vs localization:**

| Phase | Factories | Recommendation |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| 1-2 | 1-10 | **Import iridium** - simpler and cheaper |
| 3 | 10-100 | Consider Carbon complex |
| 4+ | 100+ | **Build extraction** at LRM |

**Conclusion:** The base factory operates without carbon (manganese steels, Si3N4 ceramics, iridium anodes). Carbon is an optimization for scaling, not a critical dependency.

### Stage 1. Energy

*Generation. Without this stage the factory is a pile of metal.*

#### Solar Boost

Mercury receives **9-14 kW/m²** of solar flux (vs 1.3 kW/m² on Earth) — a fundamental advantage for energy.

### First Factory Assembly (Bootstrap)

> **Details:** [First Factory Assembly (Bootstrap)](bootstrap.qmd)

*Critical checkpoint: energy autonomy within 12-24 hours.*

Gen-1 robots are light but limited by batteries (Li-S, 15-24 hour autonomy). Before charging infrastructure deployment, time is critical.

**Solution:** Checkpoint model — achieve energy autonomy within 12-24 hours, after which assembly time is constrained only by Gen-1 lifespan (2-3 years).

#### Assembly Scenarios

| Scenario | Before checkpoint | After | **Total** |
|----------|-------------------|-------|-----------|
| Optimistic | 12 h | 6 days | **7 days** |
| Realistic | 24 h | 10-15 days | **11-16 days** |
| Pessimistic | 48 h | 20-30 days | **22-32 days** |

**Key insight:** After checkpoint (24 h), time is not critical.

---

### Self-Replication

> **Details:** [Self-Replication](production/factories/assembly/replication.qmd)

Energy Bootstrap (168 MW from day one), exponential factory growth (1 -> 1000 in 16 weeks), 4 deployment phases.

### Mercury Mass Driver

Electromagnetic catapult for launching mirrors into orbit.

| Parameter | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Length | 2-3 km |
| Exit velocity | 5 km/s |

### Real Automated Factory Prototypes

#### Xiaomi Factory in Wuhan (October 2025)

The first fully automated Xiaomi home appliances factory - a real prototype of the technologies described in the book.

| Parameter | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Throughput | 1 air conditioner every 6.5 seconds, 7 million units/year |
| Operating mode | "Lights-out" - casting and metalworking shops operate without lighting or people |
| Autonomous robots | 161 units for internal logistics (covering 90% of movements) |
| Conveyor system | 4.2 km of overhead conveyors connecting 6 shops |
| Quality control | AI visual inspection, 100% testing (not sampling), accuracy +/-0.05 mm |
| First-pass yield | >99% |

**Connection to the book:**

The Ground Zero Factory is a scaled version of this concept. 2025 technologies demonstrate that the basic principles of unmanned manufacturing already work on Earth. The difference:

- **Xiaomi:** produces one type of product (air conditioners) from ready-made components
- **Ground Zero:** produces its own components and copies of itself from raw materials (self-replication)

---

### Mirror Disposal

With an ~8-year lifespan and a billion mirrors, ~100-200 million units fail annually. Without a disposal mechanism, this would create space debris accumulation.

**Solution:** Self-disposal through solar descent.

**Principle:** A mirror is a solar sail. When tilted at an angle to the Sun, a tangential force is created that decelerates orbital motion. The orbit descends in a spiral until burning up in the solar corona.

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Efficiency < 30% | Automatic transition to disposal mode |
| Loss of contact > 30 days | Autonomous decision by onboard software |
| Command from Earth | Forced disposal |

| Parameter | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Initial orbit | ~0.4 AU (Mercury's orbit) |
| Light pressure | ~60 uPa |
| Descent time | 6-12 months |
| End point | Solar corona (burn-up) |

**Failsafe:** Upon complete electronics failure, the mirror loses control -> chaotic rotation -> zero thrust -> remains in orbit but doesn't interfere (distances ~km between mirrors).

### Known Factory Limitations

> **Note:** This section describes problems specific to production. Overall project risk analysis: **[Risks and Limitations](../reference/risks.qmd)**.

#### Critical Problems

**1. Iridium Deficit**

| Parameter | Value |
|----------|-------|

## Assembly Lines

After regolith processing, clean materials are obtained: aluminum, iron, silicon, magnesium, titanium, and others. These materials go into producing **components**, which are then assembled into **finished products**.

## Production on the Moon

The Moon performs two critical functions: **testbed** (years 4-6) and **specialized manufacturer** (years 7+).

### Why the Moon?

| Advantage | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Communication delay | 1.3 sec (vs 5-20 min to Mercury) |
| Delivery cost | 60x cheaper than to Mercury |
| Control | Earth operators can intervene in real-time |
| Resources | Silicon 20%, iron 10% |

**Mistakes on the Moon are cheaper.** If a robot gets stuck, the operator sees it in 2.6 seconds and can help. On Mercury, the same situation requires 10+ minutes of waiting.

### Testbed (years 4-6)

Before sending the factory to Mercury, all technologies are validated on the Moon:

| Technology | Moon Test |
|------------|-----------|
| Regolith extraction | Moles learn to dig in 0.16g |
| Metal smelting | Solar furnace at 1.4 kW/m^2 |
| Robot assembly | Centaurs assemble Gen-2 |
| Mass Driver | Test launches before Mercury |

**Result:** By year 6, the team understands all production pitfalls in space.

### Lunar Mass Driver

Test prototype for technology validation before Mercury.

| Parameter | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Length | 1-1.5 km |
| Exit velocity | 2.5 km/s |
| Energy per ton | 3-4 GJ (1.5x more efficient than Mercury) |
| Purpose | Technology testing |

**Why shorter than Mercury's?** Moon gravity is 0.16g (vs 0.38g on Mercury). Lower velocity = shorter acceleration track.

### LSP Station Construction

The Moon builds **LSP stations at limbs** for receiving energy from the Swarm:

| Component | Material | Source |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Photovoltaics | Silicon | Moon (regolith) |
| Structure | Aluminum | Moon (anorthosite) |
| Antennas | Aluminum | Moon |

**Process:** Lunar factories produce modules -> rovers deliver to limbs -> robots assemble stations.

### Moon Power Supply

| Phase | Source | Power |
|-------|--------|-------|
| 1 (years 4-6) | Solar panels | 10-50 MW |
| 2 (years 7+) | Energy from Swarm via LSP | 0.01 PW |

**Night problem:** Lunar night lasts 14 Earth days. Factories stop, batteries discharge. Solution - batteries + energy from Swarm (when LSP becomes operational).

---

## Production Comparison

| Aspect | Mercury | Moon |
|--------|---------|------|
| **Solar flux** | 9-14 kW/m^2 | 1.4 kW/m^2 |
| **Strategy** | Self-replication | Direct delivery |
| **Main product** | Mirrors (392,000/day) | LSP stations |
| **Secondary product** | Gen-2 robots | Gen-2 robots (test) |
| **Mass Driver** | 5 km/s, 2-3 km | 2.5 km/s, 1-1.5 km (test) |
| **Purpose** | Dyson Swarm | Testbed + energy reception |
| **Control** | Autonomous (AI) | Manual (1.3 sec) |
| **Initial investment** | 62 t (one factory) | ~100 t (components) |
| **Ramp-up** | 0 years | 1-2 years |
| **Night downtime** | None (poles) | 14 days/month |

### Why Not Mercury Only?

**Testbed.** Technology validation on Mercury is too risky: 8-20 minute communication delay, delivery takes months. On the Moon: 1.3 sec delay, 3-day delivery. Moon mistakes are fixed quickly and cheaply.

**LSP stations.** Energy from the Swarm must be received on the Moon - it's visible from Earth. Microwaves from Mercury's surface won't reach Earth.

### Why Not Moon Only?

**Energy.** 1.4 kW/m^2 vs 10 kW/m^2 - a 7x difference. Self-replication on the Moon would require 7x more panels and time. Exponential growth stalls.

**Night.** 14 days without sun every month. Factories idle, batteries discharge. On Mercury's poles, the sun shines constantly.

### Earth -> Mercury

| Cargo | When | Mass |
|-------|------|------|
| First factory | Year 0 | 62 t |
| Vitamins | Years 1-10 | ~17 kg/factory/year |

**Vitamins** are what Mercury doesn't have: iridium (anodes), rare earths (magnets), carbon (lubricants).

### Mercury -> Swarm

| Parameter | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Product | Mirrors (116 kg, 100x100 m) |
| Rate | 600,000 units/day (1,500 F-M x 400/day) |
| Flight time | Several months |
| Orbit | 0.1-0.2 AU from Sun |

### Moon: LSP Stations

| Parameter | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Products | LSP station modules |
| Location | Moon limbs (east/west) |
| Purpose | Receive energy from Swarm, transmit to Earth |

### Moon -> Earth (energy)

| Parameter | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Power | 1 PW (50x world consumption) |
| Transmission method | Microwaves |
| Receivers | Rectenna (deserts, steppes) |

### Closed Energy Cycle

After LSP launch (year 6-7), energy begins circulating:

1. **Swarm** reflects light -> **LSP stations on Moon**
2. **LSP** converts to microwaves -> **Rectenna on Earth** (1 PW)
3. Part of energy -> **production on Moon** (0.01 PW)
4. Part of energy -> **Mercury** (reserve)

**Result:** Self-sustaining system. Factories produce mirrors -> mirrors provide energy -> energy powers factories and Earth.
