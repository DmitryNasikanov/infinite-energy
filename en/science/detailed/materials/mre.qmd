### Regolith Feed to Furnace

Between the flow splitter and the solar furnace is a **vibrating feeder with dosing system**:

1. Regolith flows into a receiving hopper above the furnace
2. Vibration drive ensures uniform feed rate
3. Gate valve regulates feed speed
4. Regolith drops into the furnace crucible through the loading port

Feed is **batch-based**: load 500 kg → melt → transfer to MRE cell → load next batch.

## Solar Furnace

**Principle:** Concentration of sunlight by mirrors into a single point. On Mercury, solar flux is ~10 kW/m² — 7 times greater than on Earth.

**Why not an electric furnace?**

Electricity on Mercury is precious — it's needed for electrolysis, motors, electronics. Sunlight is free and abundant. Mirrors focus 10 MW of thermal energy directly into the crucible, bypassing the light→electricity→heat conversion.

| Parameter | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Type | Parabolic concentrator |
| Mirror area | ~1000 m² |
| Focus temperature | 1500–2000°C |
| Power | ~10 MW (thermal) |
| Efficiency | ~90% (no convection in vacuum) |

### Construction and Materials

```{ojs}
unitWidget("EQU-003")
```

An array of flat mirrors directs light to a parabolic reflector. The reflector focuses the beam into the crucible containing regolith.

**Safety principle:** Mirrors _reflect_ light (operating T <100°C), they don't absorb it. All thermal energy is concentrated in the MgO crucible¹ (operating T 1500–2000°C, melting point = 2852°C — margin of 852°C). The rest of the structure remains cold (<200°C).

¹ Magnite (MgO) is produced from local magnesium in regolith (slag distillation, 8% content, ~48 t/day).

**Advantages of vacuum:**
- No convection — heat is not carried away by air
- No oxidation — crucible doesn't burn externally
- No atmospheric absorption — all light reaches the target

> **Note:** These are **ground-based** concentrator mirrors on Mercury's surface, not to be confused with the orbital Dyson Swarm. The first mirror set (~1 t, Kapton) is delivered from Earth, then produced locally from aluminum. See [Production](../../summaries/production.qmd#energy).

> **Furnace role:** The solar furnace **only melts** regolith. Electrolysis and oxygen collection occur in a separate enclosed MRE cell, where melt is transferred via MHD channel.

## Molten Regolith Electrolysis ([MRE](../../reference/technology-readiness.qmd#mre-electrolysis))

**Principle:** Passing current through molten regolith. Metals are deposited at the cathode, oxygen is released at the anode.

### Process Chemistry

Regolith at 1500°C is molten oxides: SiO₂, Al₂O₃, FeO, MgO, CaO. During electrolysis:

- **Cathode (−):** Metals are reduced
  - Fe²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Fe (settles to bottom, density 7.8 g/cm³)
  - Si⁴⁺ + 4e⁻ → Si (mixes with Fe → ferrosilicon)
  - Al³⁺ + 3e⁻ → Al (floats, density 2.7 g/cm³)
  - Mg²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Mg (floats together with Al)

- **Anode (+):** Oxygen is released
  - O²⁻ → ½O₂ + 2e⁻

| Parameter | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Temperature | 1500°C (maintained by solar furnace) |
| Voltage | 2–4 V |
| Current | 10,000–50,000 A |
| Power | ~500 kW (electrical) |
| O₂ yield | ~40% of regolith mass |

### MRE Cell Construction

The MRE cell is an **enclosed** ceramic vessel, separate from the solar furnace:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Shell | Steel casing with MgO lining |
| Lid | Ceramic, with ports for anodes |
| Anodes | Iridium rods, immersed in melt from above |
| Cathode | Cell bottom (conductive) |
| Gas hood | Above melt, collects O₂ |
| O₂ outlet | Pipe to compressor |

```{ojs}
unitWidget("EQU-002")
```

### Oxygen Collection Principle

1. Oxygen is released at anodes (O₂ bubbles rise through melt)
2. Gas collects in hood above melt surface
3. Pipe channels O₂ to cryogenic compressor
4. Liquefied O₂ is stored in insulated tanks (−183°C)

> **Important:** The solar furnace is **open** at the top for the solar beam and only melts regolith. Oxygen is released in the **enclosed** MRE cell, where melt is transferred via MHD channel.

### Product Separation by Density

The melt in the cell spontaneously stratifies into layers of different density:

```
     ┌─────────────────────────┐
     │       Gas hood          │ ─→ O₂ (pipe to compressor)
     │  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   │
     │     Al/Mg (ρ=2.5)       │ ─→ Skimmer (ladle from top)
     │  - - - - - - - - - - -  │
     │    Silicate slag        │    (remains, periodically removed)
     │  - - - - - - - - - - -  │
     │     Fe/Si (ρ=6.0)       │ ─→ MHD valve (magnetic gate)
     └─────────────────────────┘
```

| Output | Method | Frequency |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| O₂ | Continuous pipe extraction | Constant |
| Al/Mg | Skimmer removes crust | Every 30 min |
| Fe/Si | MHD valve opens | Every 2-4 hours |

**Reduction order (by Gibbs energy):** Cr → Mn → Fe → Si → Ti → Al → Mg → Ca. Metals with low energy (Fe, Mn) are reduced first and sink. Metals on the right (Al, Mg) float into slag.

**Note on anodes:** Anodes are consumable — oxygen gradually oxidizes the material. Iridium anodes last ~6 months. This is the only component requiring regular import from Earth (mass ~10 kg/year per cell).

## Product Separation

### Slag Skimmer

Mechanical removal of Al/Mg crust from melt surface.

| Component | Material | Mass | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Ladle | **SiC** (silicon carbide, melting point 2730°C) | 8 kg | Local |
| Lever arm | Fe-6%Mn steel | 20 kg | Local |
| Actuator | NaK hydraulics | 12 kg | Local |
| Accumulator | Al₂O₃ ceramic | 30 kg | Local |
| **Total** | | **70 kg** | **100% local** |

> **Localization:** Fully local production. SiC is synthesized by the Acheson process from local Si (MRE) and C (LRM zones). Ladle replacement — approximately every 2 years under intensive operation.

### MHD Valve (Bottom Fe/Si Drain)

On an automated factory without personnel, an **MHD valve** is used — the same principle as an MHD pump, but in reverse.

| Parameter | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Principle | Magnetic field holds conducting melt |
| Closed | Field creates back-pressure — melt doesn't flow |
| Open | Field switched off — melt flows under gravity |
| Regulation | Field strength = flow rate |
| Materials | Al coils, MgO ceramic channel — **all local** |

**MHD valve advantages:**

- No moving parts in contact with melt
- No wear — magnetic field doesn't wear out
- Precise flow control (from drops to stream)
- Instant open/close
- Works at 1500°C (coils are external, conductively cooled)

### Iron Refining

Purification of Fe/Si from impurities before delivery to foundry.

| Method | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Vacuum degassing | Gas bubbles capture non-metallic inclusions |
| Vacuum degassing | Removal of dissolved gases (vacuum already exists) |
| Result | Clean ferrosilicon for casting |

## Manganese Extraction

**Source:** MnO in silicates (0.1% of crust per MESSENGER).

**Process:** During MRE electrolysis, manganese is reduced at the cathode together with iron:

| Parameter | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Reaction | MnO + 2e⁻ → Mn (metallic) |
| Mn density | 7.4 g/cm³ (≈ Fe 7.8 g/cm³) |
| Behavior | Sinks together with Fe/Si |
| Result | Automatic iron alloying |

**Yield:** ~600 kg Mn/day from 600 t regolith (0.1%).

**Mn content in iron:** ~6% (600 kg Mn in 10,000 kg Fe) — higher than in ordinary steel. This is **low-alloy steel** with improved mechanical properties.

---

## Silicon Extraction

**Source:** Ferrosilicon (Fe + Si) — MRE electrolysis product. Silicon is reduced at the cathode together with iron and settles at the cell bottom.

| Parameter | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Si content in regolith | ~20% (as SiO₂) |
| Si yield | ~25 t/day (from 600 t regolith) |
| Product form | Ferrosilicon (~15% Si, ~85% Fe) |

### Silicon Purification for Electronics

Solar panels and microchips require pure silicon. Two methods:

| Method | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Aluminothermy | 3SiO₂ + 4Al → 3Si + 2Al₂O₃ (local materials) |
| Zone refining | Purification to 99.9999% (for electronics) |

**Fiberglass:** Produced on a [separate line](silicate-fabric.qmd) from silicates directly (before MRE electrolysis).
