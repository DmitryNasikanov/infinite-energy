## About Project Status

This is a **feasibility study**. All calculations are order-of-magnitude estimates and require detailed engineering work during the R&D phase.

**Study Conclusion:** Fundamental feasibility is confirmed. All necessary technologies exist or are at high readiness levels (TRL 4-9). Budget ($350-750B) and timeline (10-15 years) are comparable to other human megaprojects.

## Quick Start

### [Project in 5 Minutes](executive-summary.qmd)
Complete project overview: Swarm of 1.1 billion mirrors → 100 PW reflected energy → 21 PW on Earth (1000× global consumption). Four deployment phases, key technologies, budget $350-750B.

### [Why Mercury?](summaries/comparison.qmd)
Why Mercury instead of Moon or Mars? Comparison by solar flux (10 vs 1.4 kW/m²), Mass Driver challenges, recycling of retired mirrors. Analysis of political and technical risks for each location.

### [Risks and Limitations](reference/risks.qmd)
Honest analysis: 5 solved critical risks, 6 open technical problems (mirror degradation, iridium deficit). What can go wrong and how it's accounted for.

## Calculations and Reviews

### [Budget](summaries/budget.qmd)
Three scenarios: $350B (optimistic), $570B (baseline), $750B (conservative). Comparison with Apollo ($280B), ISS ($150-250B). Analysis of potential underestimates: AI, infrastructure, contingencies.

### [Roadmap](summaries/roadmap.qmd)
Timeline of 4 phases: R&D (years 1-4) → Moon (4-6) → Mercury (6-10) → Swarm. Critical path: blitz factory assembly in 7 days, first MD in 6 months. Year 1: 47 TW to Earth, year 3: 1000 Mass Drivers.

### [Moon](summaries/moon.qmd)
Dual role: technology proving ground + LSP stations for energy reception. Advantages of limbs (continuous operation, 14.75-day cycle). 1.3 sec communication delay allows near-real-time operator control.

### [Mars](summaries/mars.qmd) *(perspective)*
Terraforming as a side project after main completion: magnetic shield (100-1000 satellites, 100 GW), polar heating (500 TW, 2-3 months), greenhouse effect. First lake by 2072, breathable atmosphere in 150-300 years. Consumes only 15% of Swarm power.

## Detailed Topics

### [Swarm Mirrors](detailed/mirrors.qmd)
Design of frameless 100×100 m mirror (116 kg). **[Project Energy](detailed/mirrors.qmd#энергетический-каскад):** cascade efficiency 18%, power on Earth ~21 PW. Attitude control without fuel via electrochromics and light pressure. Thermal balance (+38°C), degradation (8-12 year lifespan), "Orbit Cranking" for inclination changes.

### [LSP Stations](detailed/hub.qmd)
Why lunar LSP stations (Lunar Surface Power) instead of orbital Hub (18% vs 10% efficiency, no 7,900 km² radiator problem). Placement of 20-40 stations on lunar limbs, microwave transmission at 230 W/m². Global rectenna network (Sahara, Gobi, Atacama, Australia).

### [Delivery](detailed/delivery.qmd)
Earth → Moon → Mercury logistics: ~900 launches over 4 years, 200-275 launches in peak year. Carrier requirements (Starship 2027+, Long March 9 2033+), cost $55-165B. Synergy with Artemis, Chang'e, ILRS programs.

### [Production](detailed/production.qmd)
Two centers: Mercury (mirrors, [self-replication](reference/technology-readiness.qmd#саморепликация-заводов) 1→~1650 factories) and Moon (proving ground + LSP). F-M (~400 mirrors/day), F-R (robots, domes, equipment). Gen-2 robots (Mole-M, Crab-M, Centaur-M). Critical resources: iridium, carbon, "Vitamins" (electronics and rare elements from Earth).

### [First Factory Assembly (Bootstrap)](detailed/bootstrap.qmd)
Unique project phase: Gen-1 robots (Li-S batteries, 15-24 h autonomy) assemble first factory from 100% imported materials. **Critical checkpoint:** energy autonomy within 12-24 hours. After checkpoint, assembly time is not critical — constrained only by Gen-1 lifespan (2-3 years). Three scenarios: 7/11-16/22-32 days.

## Reference

### [Risks and Limitations](reference/risks.qmd)
