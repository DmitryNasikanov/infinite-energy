## About Project Status

This is a **feasibility study**. All calculations are order-of-magnitude estimates and require detailed engineering work during the R&D phase.

**Study Conclusion:** Fundamental feasibility is confirmed. All necessary technologies exist or are at high readiness levels (TRL 4-9). Budget ($255-520B) and timeline (10-15 years) are comparable to other human megaprojects.

## Quick Start

### 1. [Project in 5 Minutes](executive-summary.qmd) *(~9 min)*
Complete project overview: Swarm of 1.1 billion mirrors → ~114 PW solar energy → 21 PW on Earth (1000× global consumption). Four deployment phases, key technologies, budget $255-520B.

### 2. [Roadmap](summaries/roadmap.qmd) *(~26 min)*
Timeline of 4 phases: R&D (years 1-4) → Moon (4-6) → Mercury (6-10) → Swarm. Critical path: blitz factory assembly in 7 days, first MD in 6 months. Year 1: 47 TW to Earth, year 3: 1000 Mass Drivers.

### 3. [Budget](summaries/budget.qmd) *(~26 min)*
Three scenarios: $255B (optimistic), $430B (baseline), $520B (conservative). Comparison with Apollo ($280B), ISS ($150-250B). Analysis of potential underestimates: AI, infrastructure, contingencies.

### 4. [Why Mercury?](summaries/comparison.qmd) *(~6 min)*
Why Mercury instead of Moon or Mars? Comparison by solar flux (10 vs 1.4 kW/m²), Mass Driver challenges, decommissioning of retired mirrors. Tradeoff "speed vs risk": Moon as backup path.

### 5. [Technologies and Sources](reference/technology-readiness.qmd) *(~22 min)*
TRL analysis of all project technologies + complete bibliography. Electromagnetic launch, lights-out factories, autonomous mining, NaS batteries, MRE electrolysis, microwave power transmission.

### 6. [Swarm Mirrors](summaries/mirrors.qmd) *(~22 min)*
Design of frameless 100×100 m mirror (116 kg). Project energy: cascade efficiency 18%, power on Earth ~21 PW. Attitude control, thermal balance, degradation (8-12 year lifespan).

### 7. [LSP Stations](detailed/hub.qmd) *(~11 min)*
Why lunar LSP stations instead of orbital Hub (18% vs 10% efficiency, no 7,900 km² radiator problem). Placement of 20-40 stations on lunar limbs, microwave transmission at 230 W/m². Global rectenna network.

### 8. [Production](summaries/production.qmd) *(~28 min)*
Two centers: Mercury (mirrors, self-replication 1→~1650 factories) and Moon (testbed + LSP). F-M (~400 mirrors/day), F-R (robots, domes, equipment). Critical resources: iridium, carbon, "Vitamins".

### 9. [Risks and Limitations](reference/risks.qmd)
Honest analysis: 5 solved critical risks, 6 open technical problems (mirror degradation, iridium deficit). What can go wrong and how it's accounted for.

## Additional Topics

### [Moon](summaries/moon.qmd)
Triple role: technology proving ground + LSP stations for energy reception + backup site (less risky alternative to Mercury). 1.3 sec communication delay allows near-real-time operator control.

### [Mars](summaries/mars.qmd) *(perspective)*
Terraforming as a side project after main completion: magnetic shield (100-1000 satellites, 100 GW), polar heating (500 TW, 2-3 months), greenhouse effect. First lake by 2072, breathable atmosphere in 150-300 years. Consumes only 15% of Swarm power.

### [Delivery](summaries/delivery.qmd)
Earth → Moon → Mercury logistics: ~50-100 launches over ~10 years (thanks to 99.998% localization), 15-30 launches in peak year. Cost $8-20B. Synergy with Artemis, Chang'e, ILRS programs.

### [First Factory Assembly (Bootstrap)](detailed/bootstrap.qmd)
Unique project phase: Gen-1 robots assemble first factory from 100% imported materials. Critical checkpoint: energy autonomy within 12-24 hours. Three scenarios: 7/11-16/22-32 days.
