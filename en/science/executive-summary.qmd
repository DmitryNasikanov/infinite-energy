## The Idea

::: {.callout-note}
## Document Status

This document is a **conceptual design** (feasibility study). The goal is to demonstrate the fundamental feasibility of the project and identify the critical path for implementation.

All calculations presented are **order-of-magnitude estimates**. Transitioning to implementation will require:

- Detailed engineering development of each subsystem
- Work by research institutes and design bureaus
- Prototyping and field testing

This is precisely why the first years of the project (1-4) are entirely dedicated to **R&D** — research and development work.
:::

Build a **Dyson Swarm** — ~1.1 billion mirrors around the Sun, producing **~100 petawatts** of reflected energy. First phase: **1 PW on Earth** (50x global consumption). Full potential with LSP scaling: up to ~21 PW (18% transmission efficiency).

**Problems this can solve:**

- **Global warming** — fossil fuel replacement + CO2 capture + orbital cooling
- **Hunger** — vertical farms, water desalination, fertilizer synthesis
- **Waste** — recycling any waste through high-temperature plasma decomposition
- **Interstellar travel** — laser sails for acceleration to 20% of light speed
- **Mars terraforming** — magnetic shield for atmosphere retention + heating + oxygen production

- Gen-1 robots for [delivery](detailed/delivery.qmd) to Moon and Mercury
- Electronics — "Vitamins" for the entire project

**Launch vehicles:**
- ~900 launches over 4 years
- Payload capacity: ~50 tons to Mercury
- Rocket industry grows organically (satellites, lunar programs)

> **Learn more:** [Roadmap](summaries/roadmap.qmd), [Budget](summaries/budget.qmd)

## Moon: Testbed

The Moon is a key stage between Earth and Mercury.

### Technology Testing (years 4-6)

- Robots learn to mine, smelt, build
- Errors are cheaper: 1.3 sec communication (vs 8-20 min), 3-day delivery (vs months)
- Experience transfers to Mercury

### Test Mass Driver

Prototype of Mercury MD for technology validation:

| Parameter | Mercury | Moon (test) |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Target velocity | 5 km/s | 2.5 km/s |
| Track length | 2-3 km | 1-1.5 km |
| Purpose | Mirror launch | Technology validation |

## Mercury: Production

The main factory of the project. [Why Mercury, not the Moon?](summaries/comparison.qmd)

- **Energy:** solar flux 10 kW/m^2 — 7x more than on the Moon
- **Resources:** the planet's metallic core — the richest deposit of iron and aluminum in the Solar System
- **Orbit:** The Swarm orbits the Sun — doesn't occupy useful orbits around Earth
- **Disposal:** failed mirrors fall into the Sun — no space debris

    D --> F[Launch]

```

### Self-replication

Robots build robots. Factories build factories.

- **99% of mass** — from local resources (**iron** for frames, **aluminum** for bodies, silicon)
- **1% of mass** — "Vitamins" from Earth (electronics, optics)
- **Gen-2 robots** — optimized (~960 kg): Al frames + Fe critical components
- **Energy:** 168 MW (3 trips of GaAs panels) — bootstrap without waiting for Swarm
- **Critical path:** First MD (~1 month) -> first mirrors -> scaling

Over **~9.5 years:** 1 factory -> ~1,650 factories (1,500 F-M + 150 F-R) -> 1.1 billion working mirrors (degradation already included)

## Dyson Swarm: Mirrors

~1 billion [mirrors](detailed/mirrors.qmd) in heliocentric orbits.

**Each mirror:**
- Size: 100 x 100 m
- Material: 4 um aluminum foil
- Mass: ~116 kg
- Power on Earth: ~19 MW (at 18% efficiency)

**Organization:**
- Mirrors grouped into clusters of 1,000-10,000 units
- Each cluster — a virtual antenna ~100 km
- Clusters focus light on LSP stations (Moon)

**After first mirrors launch:**
- Part of energy -> Earth (via LSP)
- Part of energy -> Moon (for continued construction)
- Part of energy -> Mercury (for factories and Mass Drivers)

## Energy to Earth: LSP + Rectenna

The final link in the chain: Swarm light -> electricity on Earth.

### LSP Stations (Lunar Solar Power)

**Network of 20-40 stations on the Moon's surface** (instead of an orbital hub):

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Stations | 20-40 |
| Location | Moon limbs (eastern + western) |
| Transmission | Microwaves 2.45 GHz |
| Efficiency (Swarm to Earth) | 18% |

**How it works:**

1. **Reception** — concentrated light from Swarm onto PV panels
2. **Conversion** — light -> electricity -> microwaves
3. **Transmission** — microwave beam to rectenna on Earth

**LSP advantages:**
- Heat dissipates into ground — no radiators needed in space
- 18% efficiency (vs 10% for orbital hub)
- Built from lunar resources

### Rectenna on Earth

Global network of microwave receivers:

| Region | Location | Note |
|--------|----------|------|
| **Russia** | Yakutia, Kazakhstan | Sparsely populated areas |
| **Europe** | Southern Spain | Semi-desert, close to consumers |
| **USA** | Nevada/Arizona | Desert, close to consumers |
| Africa | Sahara | Large-scale generation |
| Asia | Gobi (Mongolia) | Large-scale generation |
| S. America | Atacama (Chile) | Large-scale generation |
| Oceania | Central Australia | Large-scale generation |

Microwaves pass through clouds — all-weather operation.

## Risks

1. **Logistics:** ~900 heavy rocket launches over 4 years — requires spaceport coordination
2. **Lunar production:** LSP station deployment on limbs — new technology
3. **Mercury production:** factory self-replication — complex autonomous system

## Conclusion

::: {.callout-tip}
## Study Results

This feasibility study confirms: **the project is achievable with current technology levels**.

**Key facts:**

- All critical technologies exist (TRL 5-9) or are actively being developed
- Budget of $350-750B is comparable to Apollo ($280B) and ISS ($150B)
- Timeline of 10-15 years — realistic with international cooperation
- First energy on Earth — as early as year 8-9 from start

**Why this matters:**
Project Helios is the only known solution capable of providing humanity with energy at a scale of **1000x current consumption**. This enables not only solving the climate crisis but also opening the path to Mars terraforming, interstellar travel, and sustainable civilization development.

**Recommendation:** The project deserves high priority and international attention as the most promising path to solving global energy problems.
