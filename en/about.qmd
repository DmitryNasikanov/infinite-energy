## Story

Several years ago, Dmitry's life changed in an instant. A cervical spine injury resulted in him losing control of his body — complete paralysis below the neck. He cannot walk, cannot use his hands, even his fingers don't respond. The body that was once an obedient instrument has now become a prison.

But a person is more than just a body. Dmitry has a loving wife and three children, for whom it's worth living and fighting. They are his support, his source of strength, his hope that tomorrow will be better than today. It was his family that gave him the strength not to give up and to find new meaning in life, which manifested in this project.

## Education

Dmitry doesn't claim to be a scientist — he's a practitioner with a technical mindset. Behind him is a mathematics degree from St. Petersburg State University and many years of experience as a programmer. This combination — mathematical thinking and an engineering approach — allows him to systematically analyze complex problems and find solutions where others see only obstacles.

Project Helios was born not from academic research, but from persistent collection and systematization of knowledge. Years of work went into gathering scientific articles, engineering calculations, space mission data, and references to existing technologies. All of this came together into a picture that convinced Dmitry: the project is feasible. Not in a hundred years, not in the distant future — but in our lifetime, if humanity makes that decision.

## Philosophy

In 1964, Soviet astronomer Nikolai Kardashev proposed a scale of civilization development based on the amount of energy they can utilize. A Type I civilization uses all the energy of its planet. Type II — all the energy of its star. Type III — all the energy of its galaxy.

Humanity today doesn't even reach Type I. We burn fossil fuels like children playing with matches, while right next to us burns a thermonuclear reactor with a power output of 386 septillion watts — our Sun.

Dmitry believes that we stand on the threshold of the greatest transition in history — from a civilization dependent on the finite resources of a single planet to a civilization drawing energy directly from a star. The technologies for this already exist or are within reach. All that's missing is the will and understanding that this is possible.

Perhaps in his lifetime, medicine will also advance far enough. For now — he writes about a world where this has already happened.

## Invitation to Participate

This project is not a loner's manifesto or a utopian fantasy. It's an attempt to gather existing knowledge and show: the path to the stars is open, we just need to take the first step.

Dmitry invites everyone who is interested to look at the proposed implementation with a critical eye. How sensible is it? Where are the weak points? What can be improved? What technologies have been overlooked?

One person cannot build a Dyson Swarm — that's a task for all of humanity. But one person can start a conversation. Can gather the first like-minded individuals. Can show that the dream of infinite energy is not fantasy, but an engineering challenge with specific parameters.

If you're an engineer, physicist, economist, programmer, or simply someone who cares about the future — join in. Study the materials, ask questions, suggest improvements. A common future is built together.

## Connection to the Book

"Helios" is two things at once: a science fiction novel and technical documentation. The book tells the story of people who dared to attempt the impossible, while the "Science" section shows exactly how that impossible becomes possible.

This is a manifesto of hope for those tired of apocalyptic scenarios. A story about how people of different countries and cultures can unite for a common goal. About technologies that will change everything. About faith that humanity's best days are ahead.
