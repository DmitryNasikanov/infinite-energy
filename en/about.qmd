## Story

After a neck injury, Dmitry cannot walk. His fingers don't work — only his hands. But this doesn't stop him from writing.

He is a father of three children. And the author of this book.

## Philosophy

Dmitry believes that humanity can unite for a great purpose. That science will solve fundamental problems — energy, resources, medicine. That progress cannot be stopped.

Perhaps in his lifetime, medicine will advance far enough to help him too. Until then — he writes about a world where this has already happened.

## Connection to the Book

"Helios" is not just science fiction. It's a manifesto of hope. A story about how people from different countries build a common future. About technologies that will change everything. About faith that tomorrow will be better than today.
