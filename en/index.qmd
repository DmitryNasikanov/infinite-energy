## A Historical Science Fiction Epic

About the project that changed humanity. About how engineers, scientists, and politicians dared to commit the boldest heist in history — stealing a star's energy to save civilization.

From one engineer's dream to a planetary movement. From Moscow through India and Beijing to the Moon and Mercury. A story about what happens when energy scarcity is the only thing standing between survival and humanity's prosperity.
