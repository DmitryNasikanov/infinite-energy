# What if Mercury could power Earth with 1000x its energy needs?

**Project Helios** is a hard sci-fi novel backed by a full engineering appendix. It explores a near-future scenario where humanity builds a solar swarm around Mercury — 1.1 billion autonomous mirrors redirecting sunlight to Earth via orbital laser relay.

Not a Dyson sphere. Not fusion. Just mirrors, robots, and a lot of aluminum.

## Key Numbers

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Mirrors | 1.1 billion |
| Total mirror area | 11,000 km² |
| Power delivered to Earth | 1 PW (50x world consumption) |
| Factories on Mercury | 1,650 |
| Mass drivers | 1,000 |
| Import from Earth | ~100,000 tonnes (total) |
| Construction time | ~10 years |
| Budget estimate | $350-930B (depending on scenario) |

## What's Inside

- **Novel** — 11 chapters following the political and engineering journey
- **Engineering appendix** — mirror optics, MRE electrolysis, mass driver physics, robot fleet logistics, orbital mechanics, energy transmission
- **Risk register** — honest assessment of what we don't know yet
- **Bill of materials** — every tonne accounted for

## Tech Stack (of the megastructure)

- Molten Regolith Electrolysis (TRL 5-6) for metal extraction
- Electromagnetic mass drivers for orbital delivery
- Aluminum foil mirrors with electro-chromic orientation
- NaK-cooled cryogenic conductors
- Autonomous robot fleet (3 species, 2 generations)
