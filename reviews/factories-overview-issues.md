## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Incorrect Power Reserve Value (Line 376)

**Issue:** The power reserve calculation was incorrect.

**Original value:** 148 MW
**Corrected value:** 152 MW

**Calculation verification:**
- Available energy: 168 MW (from 3 GaAs panel shipments from Earth)
- Factory consumption: ~16 MW
- Reserve: 168 - 16 = 152 MW

**Status:** Fixed
